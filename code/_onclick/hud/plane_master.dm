/*!
 * This system works by exploiting BYONDs color matrix filter to use layers to handle emissive blockers.
 *
 * Emissive overlays are pasted with an atom color that converts them to be entirely some specific color.
 * Emissive blockers are pasted with an atom color that converts them to be entirely some different color.
 * Emissive overlays and emissive blockers are put onto the same plane.
 * The layers for the emissive overlays and emissive blockers cause them to mask eachother similar to normal BYOND objects.
 * A color matrix filter is applied to the emissive plane to mask out anything that isn't whatever the emissive color is.
 * This is then used to alpha mask the lighting plane.
