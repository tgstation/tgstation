			However, this greater mobility comes at a cost, and the suit is ineffective at protecting the wearer from the vacuum of space. \
			The suit does come pre-equipped with a special psi-emitter stealth module that makes it impossible to recognize the wearer \
			as well as causing significant demoralization amongst Nanotrasen crew."
