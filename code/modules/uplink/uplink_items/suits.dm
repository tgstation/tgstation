			this suit proves to be cheaper than your standard issue MODsuit, with none of the movement restrictions of the space suits employed by the company. \
			However, this greater mobility comes at a cost, and the suit is ineffective at protecting the wearer from the vacuum of space. \
			The suit does come pre-equipped with a special psi-emitter stealth module that makes it impossible to recognize the wearer \
			as well as causing significant demoralization amongst Nanotrasen crew."
