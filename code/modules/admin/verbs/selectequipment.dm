 * This is the datum housing the select equipment UI.
 *
 * You may notice some oddities about the way outfits are passed to the UI and vice versa here.
 * That's because it handles both outfit typepaths (for normal outfits) *and* outfit objects (for custom outfits).
 *
 * Custom outfits need to be objects as they're created in runtime.
 * "Then just handle the normal outfits as objects too and simplify the handling" - you may say.
 * There are about 300 outfit types at the time of writing this. Initializing all of these to objects would be a huge waste.
