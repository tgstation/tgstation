/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/oldstation/protosuit
	name = "B01-MOD modular suit Report"
	default_raw_text = "<b>*Prototype MODsuit*</b><br><br>This is a prototype powered exoskeleton, a design not seen in hundreds of years, \
		the first post-void war era modular suit to ever be safely utilized by an operator. \
		This ancient clunker is still functional, though it's missing several modern-day luxuries from \
		updated Nakamura Engineering designs. Primarily, the suit's myoelectric suit layer is entirely non-existant, \
		and the servos do very little to help distribute the weight evenly across the wearer's body, \
		making it slow and bulky to move in. Additionally, the armor plating never finished production aside from the shoulders, \
		forearms, and helmet; making it useless against direct attacks. The internal heads-up display is rendered entirely in \
		monochromatic cyan, leaving the user unable to see long distances. However, the way the helmet retracts is pretty cool."

	name = "Health Analyzer Report"

	capable of diagnosing even the most critical, obscure or technical injuries any humanoid entity is suffering in an easy to understand format that even a non-trained health professional \
	can understand.<br><br>The health analyzer is expected to go into full production as standard issue medical kit."

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/oldstation/protogun
	name = "K14 Energy Gun Report"
	default_raw_text = "<b>*K14-Multiphase Energy Gun*</b><br><br>The K14 Prototype Energy Gun is the first Energy Rifle that has been successfully been able to not only hold a larger ammo charge \
	than other gun models, but is capable of swapping between different energy projectile types on command with no incidents.<br><br>The weapon still suffers several drawbacks, its alternative, \
	non laser fire mode, can only fire one round before exhausting the energy cell, the weapon also remains prohibitively expensive, nonetheless NT Market Research fully believe this weapon \
	will form the backbone of our Energy weapon catalogue.<br><br>The K14 is expected to undergo revision to fix the ammo issues, the K15 is expected to replace the 'stun' setting with a \
	'disable' setting in an attempt to bypass the ammo issues."

/obj/item/paper/fluff/ruins/oldstation/protosupermatter
	name = "Supermatter Crystal Generator"
	default_raw_text = "<b>*Supermatter Crystal Shard*</b><br><br>Modern power generation typically comes in two forms, a Fusion Generator or a Fission Generator. Fusion provides the best space to power \
	ratio, and is typically seen on military or high security ships and stations, however Fission reactors require the usage of expensive and rare materials in its construction. \
	Fission generators are massive and bulky, and require a large reserve of uranium to power, however they are extremely cheap to operate and need little maintenance once \
	\noperational.<br><br>The Supermatter aims to alter this, a functional Supermatter is essentially a gas producer that generates far more radiation than Fusion or Fission generators can ever hope to produce. "

	default_raw_text = "I was on a mission of an exploration drone reclamation, when I lost the signal. I've had just enough pressure to make it back to the station.... But this is really bad... <br><br> \
	Beta looks like a smashed tin can, and Alpha is gone completely. I didn't manage to find anyone except those sleeping beauties and something I don't even know how to explain. The blood and gore is everywhere, those things took out the entire R&D. \
	They're hissing and crawling behind the maintenance hatch that I welded off to not let them in.<br><br> \
	I had a proximity sensor with me, so I donated my left cybernetic arm to make this little fella. One of janitor's bucket served as a perfect casing for him. <br><br> \
	Here I thought that I'll die of malnutrition, when I started feeling the symptoms of hypercapnia. I will turn you off to save the battery. It's time for both us to sleep, little guy.<br><br> \
	If you're reading this, I'm probably dead. I've opened Ramboo's maintenance pannel with my ID. Please let him help to clean up my remains..."

	Oh, how I miss her warm milk...<br><br>I've put Molly's biopsy in the fridge and almost completed the solution.<br><br> \
	Next steps:<ul><li>Pour the broth to the growing vat (beaker nearby)</li><li>Add one dropper of the solution</li><li>Add Molly's biopsy to the vat</li></ul> \
	Just need to make sure to use the correct bottle this time... I'll even mark it as <b>\"Solution for Molly\"</b>, or I tend to mix things up... <br>I can already feel the endorphin release from hugging her again.<br><br> \
	If everything goes well, I will try out those slimes the papers praising as the future of science. They say that the cell lines may be found on anything moldy and rotting, and these small blobs have crazy mutation potential when properly fed."

	The whole department is running around in panic. I'll just pray that engineers won't let the engine delaminate.<br><br> ...And the alien spawn have broken out of the containment area due to the impact and slipped into the vent.<br><br> \
	I have a bad feeling about this, but I doubt that now is the right time to make guys hunt for what they call my \"pet cockroach\"... And RD is scary..."
