/* How it works:
The shuttle arrives at CentCom dock and calls sell(), which recursively loops through all the shuttle contents that are unanchored.

Each object in the loop is checked for applies_to() of various export datums, except the invalid ones.
*/

/* The rule in figuring out item export cost:
Export cost of goods in the shipping crate must be always equal or lower than:
	packcage cost - crate cost - manifest cost
Crate cost is 500cr for a regular plasteel crate and 100cr for a large wooden one. Manifest cost is always 200cr.
This is to avoid easy cargo points dupes.

Credit dupes that require a lot of manual work shouldn't be removed, unless they yield too much profit for too little work.
For example, if some player buys iron and glass sheets and uses them to make and sell reinforced glass:

100 glass + 50 iron-> 100 reinforced glass
1500cr -> 1600cr)

Then the player gets the profit from selling his own wasted time.
