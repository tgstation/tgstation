//THESE ARE HARDCODED INSTRUMENT SAMPLES.
//SONGS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHED TO LEGACY MODE IF THEY USE THIS KIND OF INSTRUMENT!
//I'd prefer these stayed. They sound different from the mechanical synthesis of synthed instruments, and I quite like them that way. It's not legacy, it's hardcoded, old style. - kevinz000
