	Greetings, visitor, to  XCC-P5831! As you may know, this outpost was once \
	used as Nanotrasen's CENTRAL COMMAND STATION, organizing and coordinating company \
	projects across the vastness of space. <br>\
	Since the completion of the much more efficient CC-A5831 on March 8, 2553, XCC-P5831 no longer \
	acts as NT's base of operations but still plays a very important role its corporate affairs; \
	serving as a supply and repair depot, as well as being host to its most important legal proceedings\
	and the thrilling pay-per-view broadcasts of <i>PLASTEEL CHEF</i> and <i>THUNDERDOME LIVE</i>.<br> \
	We hope you enjoy your stay!"

	<b>To: Rolf Ingram, XCC-P5831 Quartermaster</b><br>\
	Hey, Rolf, once you pack that gateway into the ferry hangar, <i>make absolutely sure</i> \
	to deactivate it! As you may know, SS13 has recently got its network up and running, \
	which means that until we get this gate shipped off to the next colonization staging \
	area, they'll be able to hop straight in here if its hooked up on our end.<br>\
	Obviously, that's something I'd very much rather avoid. Our forensics and medical \
	teams never did figure out what happened that last time... and I can't wrap my head \
	around it myself. Why would a shuttle full of evacuees all snap and beat each other \
	to death the moment they reached safety?<br>\
