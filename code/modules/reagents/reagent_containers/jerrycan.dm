/**
* The jerrycan is not only a flavourful, setting appropriate way to store reagents, it offers several design benefits due to its unique combination of high roundstart capacity and bulky size.

* It prevents one coworker from hogging a shared reagent container.

* The high volume eases grinding and mixing without enabling big grenade creation.

* It allows reagents to be stolen or borrowed due to being stored outside the safety of an inventory.

* The highly visible inhand sprite allows you to see who is holding or transporting reagents.

* The smart cap flag allows you to throw the container without spilling.

* It reduces the tedium associated with dispensing and throwing away botany nutrient bottles, encouraging refilling.

* Bulky size prevent players from looting the can unless it is something they really want.

* Comes with a large number of visual customization options for coders who with to add new variants.
