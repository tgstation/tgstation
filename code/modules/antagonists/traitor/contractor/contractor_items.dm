	default_raw_text = {"Welcome agent, congratulations on your new position as contractor. On top of your already assigned objectives,\
		this kit will provide you contracts to take on for TC payments.\
		<p>Provided within, we give your specialist contractor space suit. It's even more compact, being able to fit into a pocket, and faster than the \
		Syndicate space suit available to you on the uplink. We also provide your chameleon jumpsuit and mask, both of which can be changed \
		to any form you need for the moment. The cigarettes are a special blend - it'll heal your injuries slowly overtime.</p>\
		<p>Your standard issue contractor baton hits harder than the ones you might be used to, and likely be your go to weapon for kidnapping your \
		targets.</p>\
		<p>The contractor hub, available at the top right of the uplink, will provide you unique items and abilities. These are bought using Contractor Rep, \
		with two Rep being provided each time you complete a contract.</p>\
		<h3>Using the tablet</h3>\
		<ol>\
			<li>Open the Syndicate Contract Uplink program.</li>\
			<li>Here, you can accept a contract, and redeem your TC payments from completed contracts.</li>\
			<li>The payment number shown in brackets is the bonus you'll receive when bringing your target <b>alive</b>. You receive the \
			other number regardless of if they were alive or dead.</li>\
			<li>Contracts are completed by bringing the target to designated dropoff, calling for extraction, and putting them \
			inside the pod.</li>\
		</ol>\
		<p>Be careful when accepting a contract. While you'll be able to see the location of the dropoff point, cancelling will make it \
		unavailable to take on again.</p>\
		<p>The tablet can also be recharged at any cell charger.</p>\
		<h3>Extracting</h3>\
		<ol>\
			<li>Make sure both yourself and your target are at the dropoff.</li>\
			<li>Call the extraction, and stand back from the drop point.</li>\
			<li>If it fails, make sure your target is inside, and there's a free space for the pod to land.</li>\
			<li>Grab your target, and drag them into the pod.</li>\
		</ol>\
		<h3>Ransoms</h3>\
		<p>We need your target for our own reasons, but we ransom them back to your mission area once their use is served. They will return back
		from where you sent them off from in several minutes time. Don't worry, we give you a cut of what we get paid. We pay this into whatever \
		ID card you have equipped, on top of the TC payment we give.</p>\
		<p>Good luck agent. You can burn this document with the supplied lighter.</p>"}
