This allows heretics to choose if they want to rush all the influences and take them stealthily, or
Construct a codex and take what's left with more points.
Another downside to having the book is strip searches, which means that it's not just a free nab, at least until you get exposed - and when you do, you'll probably need the faster drawing speed.
Overall, it's a tradeoff between speed and stealth or power.</td></tr><tr><th>/<a href="datum.html">datum</a>/<a href="datum/heretic_knowledge.html">heretic_knowledge</a>/bookworm</th><td>Warren King's Welcome
Ritual available at the start. So that heretics can easily gain access to maintenance airlocks without having to rely on a HoP or having to off some poor assistant.
Gives access to solars since those doors are especially useful to get in or out of space.</td></tr></table></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/tree/c41b333c9bc46606d2c5d5b517f7836d5953fbfd">c41b333</a> (master) â€” <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.11.0</a></footer></body></html>
