/**
 * Total cheese goal to sacrifice to [REDACTED] during wizard grand rituals.
 * The easiest way for a wizard to procure cheese is with Summon Cheese spell, which summons 9 per cast.
 * The wizard needs to complete 7 rituals, so let's give them some breathing room with cheese offerings.
 * 7 * 9 = 63, so the wizard can potentially miss two casts worth of cheese if they summon cheese on each rune.

/**
 * The Grand Ritual is the Wizard's alternate victory condition
 * and also a tool to make funny distractions and progress the round state.
 *
 * The wizard is assigned a random area to perform the ritual in.
 * This entails travelling to that area, drawing a 3x3 rune, and casting on it for a while.
 * Completing these causes a random event to immediately occur and may cause additional side effects in the area.
 * The more rituals are completed, the more dramatic the events which can be spawned.
 *
 * After passing certain thresholds Grand Ritual completions will begin spawning active and expended Reality Tears.
 * Above a certian threshold, beginning the ritual will alert the crew to your location.
 *
 * The 7th ritual completion is special and allows you to pick a "finale" effect which should be very dramatic.
 * Further completion after that returns to the usual behaviour.
