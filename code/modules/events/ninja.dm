/*
	README:

	Data:

	>> space_ninja.dm << is this file. It contains a variety of procs related to either spawning space ninjas,
	modifying their verbs, various help procs, testing debug-related content, or storing unused procs for later.
	Similar functions should go into this file, along with anything else that may not have an explicit category.
	IMPORTANT: actual ninja suit, gloves, etc, are stored under the appropriate clothing files. If you need to change
	variables or look them up, look there. Easiest way is through the map file browser.

	>> ninja_abilities.dm << contains all the ninja-related powers. Spawning energy swords, teleporting, and the like.
	If more powers are added, or perhaps something related to powers, it should go there. Make sure to describe
	what an ability/power does so it's easier to reference later without looking at the code.
	IMPORTANT: verbs are still somewhat funky to work with. If an argument is specified but is not referenced in a way
	BYOND likes, in the code content, the verb will fail to trigger. Nothing will happen, literally, when clicked.
	This can be bypassed by either referencing the argument properly, or linking to another proc with the argument
	attached. The latter is what I like to do for certain cases--sometimes it's necessary to do that regardless.

	>> ninja_equipment.dm << deals with all the equipment-related procs for a ninja. Primarily it has the suit, gloves,
	and mask. The suit is by far the largest section of code out of the three and includes a lot of code that ties in
	to other functions. This file has gotten kind of large so breaking it up may be in order. I use section hearders.
	IMPORTANT: not much to say here. Follow along with the comments and adding new functions should be a breeze. Also
	know that certain equipment pieces are linked in other files. The energy blade, for example, has special
	functions defined in the appropriate files (airlock, securestorage, etc).

	General Notes:

	I created space ninjas with the expressed purpose of spicing up boring rounds. That is, ninjas are to xenos as marauders are to
	death squads. Ninjas are stealthy, tech-savvy, and powerful. Not to say marauders are all of those things, but a clever ninja
	should have little problem murderampaging their way through just about anything. Short of admin wizards maybe.
	HOWEVER!
	Ninjas also have a fairly great weakness as they require energy to use abilities. If, theoretically, there is a game
	mode based around space ninjas, make sure to account for their energy needs.

	Admin Notes:

	Ninjas are not admin PCs--please do not use them for that purpose. They are another way to participate in the game post-death,
	like pais, xenos, death squads, and cyborgs.
	I'm currently looking for feedback from regular players since beta testing is largely done. I would appreciate if
	you spawned regular players as ninjas when rounds are boring. Or exciting, it's all good as long as there is feedback.
	You can also spawn ninja gear manually if you want to.

	How to do that:
	Make sure your character has a mind.
	Change their assigned_role to "MODE", no quotes. Otherwise, the suit won't initialize.
	Change their special_role to "Space Ninja", no quotes. Otherwise, the character will be gibbed.
	Spawn ninja gear, put it on, hit initialize. Let the suit do the rest. You are now a space ninja.
	I don't recommend messing with suit variables unless you really know what you're doing.

	Miscellaneous Notes:

	Potential Upgrade Tree:
		Energy Shield:
			Extra Ability
			Syndicate Shield device?
				Works like the force wall spell, except can be kept indefinitely as long as energy remains. Toggled on or off.
				Would block bullets and the like.
		Phase Shift
			Extra Ability
			Advanced Sensors?
				Instead of being unlocked at the start, Phase Shieft would become available once requirements are met.
		Uranium-based Recharger:
			Suit Upgrade
			Unsure
				Instead of losing energy each second, the suit would regain the same amount of energy.
				This would not count in activating stealth and similar.
		Extended Battery Life:
			Suit Upgrade
			Battery of higher capacity
				Already implemented. Replace current battery with one of higher capacity.
		Advanced Cloak-Tech device.
			Suit Upgrade
			Syndicate Cloaking Device?
				Remove cloak failure rate.

Deprecated. get_dir() does the same thing. Still a nice proc.
Returns direction that the mob or whomever should be facing in relation to the target.
This proc does not grant absolute direction and is mostly useful for 8dir sprite positioning.
I personally used it with getline() to great effect.

I've tried a lot of stuff but adding verbs to the AI while inside an object, inside another object, did not want to work properly.
This was the best work-around I could come up with at the time. Uses objects to then display to panel, based on the object spell system.
Can be added on to pretty easily.

BYOND fixed the verb bugs so this is no longer necessary. I prefer verb panels.

					<h4><img src=sos_6.png> Ninja Manual:</h4>
					<h5>Who they are:</h5>
					Space ninjas are a special type of ninja, specifically one of the space-faring type. The vast majority of space ninjas belong to the Spider Clan, a cult-like sect, which has existed for several hundred years. The Spider Clan practice a sort of augmentation of human flesh in order to achieve a more perfect state of being and follow Postmodern Space Bushido. They also kill people for money. Their leaders are chosen from the oldest of the grand-masters, people that have lived a lot longer than any mortal man should.<br>Being a sect of technology-loving fanatics, the Spider Clan have the very best to choose from in terms of hardware--cybernetic implants, exoskeleton rigs, hyper-capacity batteries, and you get the idea. Some believe that much of the Spider Clan equipment is based on reverse-engineered alien technology while others doubt such claims.<br>Whatever the case, their technology is absolutely superb.
					<h5>How they relate to other SS13 organizations:</h5>
					<ul>
					<li>*<b>Nanotrasen</b> and the Syndicate are two sides of the same coin and that coin is valuable.</li>
					<li>*<b>The Space Wizard Federation</b> is a problem, mainly because they are an extremely dangerous group of unpredictable individuals--not to mention the wizards hate technology and are in direct opposition of the Spider Clan. Best avoided or left well-enough alone. How to battle: wizards possess several powerful abilities to steer clear off. Blind in particular is a nasty spell--jaunt away if you are blinded and never approach a wizard in melee. Stealth may also work if the wizard is not wearing thermal scanners--don't count on this. Run away if you feel threatened and await a better opportunity.</li>
					<li>*<b>Changeling Hivemind</b>: extremely dangerous and to be killed on sight. How to battle: they will likely try to absorb you. Adrenaline boost, then phase shift into them. If you get stung, use SpiderOS to inject counter-agents. Stealth may also work but detecting a changeling is the real battle.</li>
					<li>*<b>Xeno Hivemind</b>: their skulls make interesting kitchen decorations and are challenging to best, especially in larger nests. How to battle: they can see through your stealth guise and energy stars will not work on them. Best killed with a Phase Shift or at range. If you happen on a projectile stun weapon, use it and then close in to melee.</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>The reason they (you) are here:</h5>
					Space ninjas are renowned throughout the known controlled space as fearless spies, infiltrators, and assassins. They are sent on missions of varying nature by Nanotrasen, the Syndicate, and other shady organizations and people. To hire a space ninja means serious business.
					<h5>Their playstyle:</h5>
					A mix of traitor, changeling, and wizard. Ninjas rely on energy, or electricity to be precise, to keep their suits running (when out of energy, a suit hibernates). Suits gain energy from objects or creatures that contain electrical charge. APCs, cell batteries, rechargers, SMES batteries, cyborgs, mechs, and exposed wires are currently supported. Through energy ninjas gain access to special powers--while all powers are tied to the ninja suit, the most useful of them are verb activated--to help them in their mission.<br>It is a constant struggle for a ninja to remain hidden long enough to recharge the suit and accomplish their objective; despite their arsenal of abilities, ninjas can die like any other. Unlike wizards, ninjas do not possess good crowd control and are typically forced to play more subdued in order to achieve their goals. Some of their abilities are specifically designed to confuse and disorient others.<br>With that said, it should be perfectly possible to completely flip the fuck out and rampage as a ninja.
					<h5>Their powers:</h5>
					There are two primary types: Equipment and Abilties. Passive effect are always on. Active effect must be turned on and remain active only when there is energy to do so. Ability costs are listed next to them.
					<b>Equipment</b>: cannot be tracked by AI (passive), faster speed (passive), stealth (active), vision switch (passive if toggled), voice masking (passive), SpiderOS (passive if toggled), energy drain (passive if toggled).
					<ul>
					<li><i>Voice masking</i> generates a random name the ninja can use over the radio and in-person. Although, the former use is recommended.</li>
					<li><i>Toggling vision</i> cycles to one of the following: thermal, meson, or darkness vision. The starting mode allows one to scout the identity of those in view, revealing their role. Traitors, revolutionaries, wizards, and other such people will be made known to you.</li>
					<li><i>Stealth</i>, when activated, drains more battery charge and works similarly to a syndicate cloak. The cloak will deactivate when most Abilities are utilized.</li>
					<li><i>On-board AI</i>: The suit is able to download an AI much like an intelicard. Check with SpiderOS for details once downloaded.</li>
					<li><i>SpiderOS</i> is a specialized, PDA-like screen that allows for a small variety of functions, such as injecting healing chemicals directly from the suit. You are using it now, if that was not already obvious. You may also download AI modules directly to the OS.</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Abilities</b>:
					<ul>
					<li>*<b>Phase Shift</b> (<i>2000E</i>) and <b>Phase Jaunt</b> (<i>1000E</i>) are unique powers in that they can both be used for defense and offense. Jaunt launches the ninja forward facing up to 9 squares, somewhat randomly selecting the final destination. Shift can only be used on turf in view but is precise (cannot be used on walls). Any living mob in the area teleported to is instantly gibbed (mechs are damaged, huggers and other similar critters are killed). It is possible to teleport with a target, provided you grab them before teleporting.</li>
					<li>*<b>Energy Blade</b> (<i>500E</i>) is a highly effective weapon. It is summoned directly to the ninja's hand and can also function as an EMAG for certain objects (doors/lockers/etc). You may also use it to cut through walls and disabled doors. Experiment! The blade will crit humans in two hits. This item cannot be placed in containers and when dropped or thrown disappears. Having an energy blade drains more power from the battery each tick.</li>
					<li>*<b>EM Pulse</b> (<i>2500E</i>) is a highly useful ability that will create an electromagnetic shockwave around the ninja, disabling technology whenever possible. If used properly it can render a security force effectively useless. Of course, getting beat up with a toolbox is not accounted for.</li>
					<li>*<b>Energy Star</b> (<i>500E</i>) is a ninja star made of green energy AND coated in poison. It works by picking a random living target within range and can be spammed to great effect in incapacitating foes. Just remember that the poison used is also used by the Xeno Hivemind (and will have no effect on them).</li>
					<li>*<b>Energy Net</b> (<i>2000E</i>) is a non-lethal solution to incapacitating humanoids. The net is made of non-harmful phase energy and will halt movement as long as it remains in effect--it can be destroyed. If the net is not destroyed, after a certain time it will teleport the target to a holding facility for the Spider Clan and then vanish. You will be notified if the net fails or succeeds in capturing a target in this manner. Combine with energy stars or stripping to ensure success. Abduction never looked this leet.</li>
					<li>*<b>Adrenaline Boost</b> (<i>1 E. Boost/3</i>) recovers the user from stun, weakness, and paralysis. Also injects 20 units of radium into the bloodstream.</li>
					<li>*<b>Smoke Bomb</b> (<i>1 Sm.Bomb/10</i>) is a weak but potentially useful ability. It creates harmful smoke and can be used in tandem with other powers to confuse enemies.</li>
					<li>*<b>???</b>: unleash the <b>True Ultimate Power!</b></li>
					<h4>IMPORTANT:</h4>
					<ul>
					<li>*Make sure to toggle Special Interaction from the Ninja Equipment menu to interact differently with certain objects.</li>
					<li>*Your starting power cell can be replaced if you find one with higher maximum energy capacity by clicking on your suit with the higher capacity cell.</li>
					<li>*Conserve your energy. Without it, you are very vulnerable.</li>
					</ul>
					That is all you will need to know. The rest will come with practice and talent. Good luck!
