	/**
	 * This is a pretty complicated algorithm, but it's one I'm rather proud of.
	 *
	 * This is the function that is responsible for taking the list of preferences,
	 * and spitting out what to put them in.
	 *
	 * However, it should, wherever possible, prevent solo departments.
	 * That means that if there's one medical officer, and one engineering officer,
	 * that they should be put onto the same department (either medical or engineering).
	 *
	 * The first step is to get the "distribution". This describes how many officers
	 * should be in each department, no matter what they are.
	 * This is handled in `get_distribution`. Examples of inputs/outputs are:
	 * get_distribution(1, 4) => [1]
	 * get_distribution(2, 4) => [2]
	 * get_distribution(3, 4) => [3] # If this returned [2, 1], then we'd get a loner.
	 * get_distribution(4, 4) => [2, 2] # We have enough to put into a separate group
	 *
	 * Once this distribution is received, the next step is to figure out where to put everyone.
	 *
	 * If all members have no preference, just make one an unused department (from the departments argument).
	 * Then, call ourselves again.
	 *
	 * Order the groups from most populated to least.
	 *
	 * If the top group has enough officers who actually *want* that department, then we give it to them.
	 * If there are any leftovers (for example, if 3 officers want medical, but we only want 2), then we
	 * update those to have no preference instead.
	 *
	 * If the top group does NOT have enough officers, then we kill the least popular group by setting
	 * them all to have no preference.
	 *
	 * Anyone in the most popular group will be removed from the list, and the final tally will be updated.
	 * In the case of not having enough officers, this is a no-op, as there won't be any in the most popular group yet.
	 *
	 * If there are any candidates left, then we call the algorithm again, but for everyone who hasn't been selected yet.
	 * We take the results from that run, and put them in the correct order.
	 *
	 * As an example, let's assume we have the following preferences:
	 * [engineer, medical, medical, medical, medical, cargo]
	 *
	 * The distribution of this is [2, 2, 2], meaning there will be 3 departments chosen and they will have 2 each.
	 * We order from most popular to least popular and get:
	 * - medical: 4
	 * - engineer: 1
	 * - cargo: 1
	 *
	 * We need 2 to fill the first group. There are enough medical staff to do it. Thus, we take the first 2 medical staff
	 * and update the output, making it now: [engineer, medical, medical, ?, ?, cargo].
	 *
	 * The remaining two want-to-be-medical officers are now updated to act as no preference. We run the algorithm again.
	 * This time, are candidates are [engineer, none, none, cargo].
	 * The distribution of this is [2, 2]. The frequency is:
	 * - engineer: 1
	 * - cargo: 1
	 * - no preference: 2
	 *
	 * We need 2 to fill the engineering group, but only have one who wants to do it.
	 * We have enough no preferences for it, making our result: [engineer, engineer, none, cargo].
	 * We run the algorithm again, but this time with: [none, cargo].
	 * Frequency is:
	 * - cargo: 1
	 * - no preference: 1
	 * Enough to fill cargo, etc, and we get [cargo, cargo].
	 *
	 * These are all then compounded into one list.
	 *
	 * In the case that all are no preference, it will pop the last department, and use that.
	 * For example, if `departments` is [engi, medical, cargo], and we have the preferences:
	 * [none, none, none]...
	 * Then we will just give them all cargo.
	 *
	 * One of the most important parts of this algorithm is IT IS DETERMINISTIC.
	 * That means that this proc is 100% testable.
	 * Instead, to get random results, the preferences and departments are shuffled
	 * before the proc is ever called.
