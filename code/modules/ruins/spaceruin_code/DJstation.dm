**Welcome new owner!**
You have purchased the latest in listening equipment. The telecommunication setup we created is the best in listening to common and private radio frequencies. Here is a step by step guide to start listening in on those saucy radio channels:
1. Equip yourself with a multitool
2. Use the multitool on the relay.
3. Turn it on. It has already been configured for you to listen on.

Simple as that. Now to listen to the private channels, you'll have to configure the intercoms. They are located on the front desk. Here is a list of frequencies for you to listen on.
* 145.9 - Common Channel
