/* The thing I found with guns in ss13 is that they don't seem to simulate the rounds in the magazine in the gun.
   Afaik, since projectile.dm features a revolver, this would make sense since the magazine is part of the gun.
   However, it looks like subsequent guns that use removable magazines don't take that into account and just get
   around simulating a removable magazine by adding the casings into the loaded list and spawning an empty magazine
   when the gun is out of rounds. Which means you can't eject magazines with rounds in them. The below is a very
   rough and poor attempt at making that happen. -Ausops */
