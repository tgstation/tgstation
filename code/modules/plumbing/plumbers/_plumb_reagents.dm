 * Specialized reagent container for plumbing. Uses the round robin approach of transferring reagents
 * so transfer 5 from 15 water, 15 sugar and 15 plasma becomes 10, 15, 15 instead of 13.3333, 13.3333 13.3333. Good if you hate floating point errors

/**
 * Same as the parent trans_to except only a few arguments have impact here & the rest of the arguments are discarded.
 * Arguments
 *
 * * atom/target - the target we are transfering to
 * * amount - amount to transfer
 * * datum/reagent/target_id - the reagent id we want to transfer. if null everything gets transfered
 * * methods - this is key for deciding between round-robin or proportional transfer. It does not mean the same as the
 * parent proc. LINEAR for round robin(in this technique reagents are missing/lost/not preserved when there isn't enough space to hold them)
 * NONE means everything is transfered regardless of how much space is available in the receiver in proportions
