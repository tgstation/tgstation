		the motion of a prey or organic bait and tempt the fish, since a piece of plastic and metal ins't \
		all that appetitizing by itself. <b>Different lures</b> can be used to catch <b>different fish</b>.<br><br>\

		To help you, each lure comes with a <b>small light</b> diode that's attached to the <b>float</b> of your fishing rod. \
		A float is basically the thing bobbing up'n'down above the fishing spot. \
		The light will flash <b>green</b> and a <b>sound</b> cue will be played when the lure is <b>ready</b> to be spun. \
		Do <b>not</b> spin while the light is still <b>red</b>.<br><br>\
