//This is a plot created using the values for gas exports. Each gas has a value that works as its kind of soft-cap, which limits you from making billions of credits per sale, based on the base_value variable on the gasses themselves. Most of these gasses as a result have a rather low value when sold, like nitrogen and oxygen at 1500 and 600 respectively at their maximum value. The
