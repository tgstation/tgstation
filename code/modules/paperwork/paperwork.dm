 * # Paperwork
 *
 * Paperwork documents that can be stamped by their associated stamp to provide a bonus to cargo.
 *
 * Paperwork documents are a cargo item meant to provide the opportunity to make money.
 * Each piece of paperwork has its own associated stamp it needs to be stamped with. Selling a
 * properly stamped piece of paperwork will provide a cash bonus to the cargo budget. If a document is
 * not properly stamped it will instead drain a small stipend from the cargo budget.
