	<br>It is truly saddening you must spend your time locked up in an awful prison on that dangerous station. I have spoken to your lawyer who will attempt to appeal to the judge so your sentence may hopefully be reduced.
	<br>Regardless, I just want you to understand that all of us out here still love you, and want to see you released safely some day! I know that prison can be a very vicious place, so please promise us you'll avoid getting into any fights or trouble, okay?
	<br>We all care for your safety deeply, and could not live with ourselves if you ended up getting hurt. We've scheduled a visit to see you, and with any luck, hopefully our request will be granted soon.
	<br>Anyway, please do your best to get by in that place, and never forget we'll be always here for you, no matter if we're separated.

	<br>Please stay safe,

	<br>I didn't trust the station folk so I left
	a couple of weeks ago. But here's some
	instructions on how to operate things here.
	You can grow plants and each iteration they become
	stronger, more potent and have better yield, if you
	know which ones to pick. Use your botanist's analyzer
	for that. You can turn harvested plants into seeds
	at the seed extractor, and replant them for better stuff!
	Sometimes if the weed level gets high in the tray
	mutations into different mushroom or weed species have
	been witnessed. On the rare occasion even weeds mutate!
	<br>Either way, have fun!
	<br>Best regards,
	Billy Bob Johnson.
	<br>PS.
	Here's a few tips:
	In nettles, potency = damage
	In amanitas, potency = deadliness + side effects
	In Liberty caps, potency = drug power + effects
	In chilies, potency = heat
	<B>Nutrients keep mushrooms alive!</B>
	<B>Water keeps weeds such as nettles alive!</B>
	<B>All other plants need both.</B>"}

	<br>
	Featuring the newest in Nanotrasen technology, the Bluespace Artillery Cannon is your surefire ticket to complete and total threat elimination.
	<br>
	<h1>1. Acquire necessary resources.</h1>
	* Bluespace Artillery Bore
	* Bluespace Artillery Fusor
	* Bluespace Artillery Generator
	* Bluespace Artillery Controls
	* 26 cable pieces
	* 20 iron
	* 20 bluespace crystals (or artificial)
	* 5 quadratic capacitors
	* 5 femto servos
	* 2 glass sheets
	<h1>2. Find suitable location</h1>
	The BSA has a steep power requirement and functions best when it is on its own APC; keep other items in the room to a minimum. Ensure the BSA is placed at the edge of the station, so that it won't shoot through another portion of the station..  Make sure the room isn't easily accessible by someone who shouldn't be there.
	<h1>3. Construction</h1>
	1. Build three machine frames.
	2. Determine the desired direction you want your artillery to face.
	3. Leave six spaces in front, four behind.  The artillery cannon finishes itself after the assemblies are aligned.
	4. Place the machine frames in a horizontal line.
	5. Wrench the three machine frames in place.
	6. Install wires in the three machine frames.
	7. Install the bore in the front machine frame. This is your barrel.
	8. Install the fusor in the center machine frame.
	9. Install the generator in the back machine frame.
	10. Examine the three machines and see what else they need, you can use a screwdriver to finish the assembly when parts are installed.
	11. Construct a computer terminal in the same room as the BSA assembly, make sure they draw power from the same APC or ask the Chief Engineer to check the blueprints for you.
	12. Use a screwdriver to fasten the board, install wires and two glass sheets, use screwdriver again to turn on.
	13. Use a multitool and interact with the generator, then the fusor.
	14. Use a multitool again to interact with the bore, then the fusor.
	15. Use the console to finalize construction, make sure there's enough empty space around the BSA for the assembly to commence.
	And with that, you are done!
	<b>Commencing firing protocols requires the access of at least two heads, the console will be locked down until this requirement is met.</b>
	<b>Always make sure you are certain before attempting to fire the BSA.</b>

/obj/item/paper/guides/jobs/security/courtroom
	name = "paper- 'A Crash Course in Legal SOP on SS13'"
	default_raw_text = {"<B>Roles:</B>
	The Detective is basically the investigator and prosecutor.
	The Staff Assistant can perform these functions with written authority from the Detective.
	The Captain/HoP/Warden acts as the judicial authority.
	The Security Officers are responsible for executing warrants, security during trial, and prisoner transport.
	<br><B>Investigative Phase:</B>
	After the crime has been committed the Detective's job is to gather evidence and try to ascertain not only who did it but what happened. They must take special care to catalogue everything and must not leave anything out. They should write out all the evidence on paper, and make sure they take an appropriate number of fingerprints. If they must ask someone questions, they have permission to confront them. If the person refuses, they can ask a judicial authority to write a subpoena for questioning. If again they fail to respond, that person is to be jailed as insubordinate and obstructing justice. Said person will be released after they cooperate.
	<br>Once the FT has a clear idea as to who the criminal is, they are to write an arrest warrant. IT MUST LIST THE CHARGES. The FT is to then go to the judicial authority and explain a small version of their case. If the case is moderately acceptable the authority should sign it. Security must then execute said warrant.
	<br><B>Pre-Pre-Trial Phase:</B>
	A legal representative must be provided to the defendant if the defendant requests one. That person and the defendant are then to be given time to meet (in the brig IS ACCEPTABLE). The defendant and their lawyer are then to be given a copy of all the evidence that will be presented at trial (rewriting it all on paper is fine). THIS IS CALLED THE DISCOVERY PACK. With a few exceptions, THIS IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE BOTH SIDES MAY USE AT TRIAL. IF the prosecution will be seeking the death penalty it MUST be stated at this time. ALSO if the defense will be seeking not guilty by mental defect it must state this at this time to allow ample time for examination.
	At this time, each side is to compile a list of witnesses. By default, the defendant is on both lists. The defense and prosecution can compile more evidence beforehand BUT in order for it to be admissible the evidence MUST also be given to the other side.\nThe defense has time to compile motions against some evidence here.
	<B>Possible Motions:</B>
	1. <U>Invalidate Evidence-</U> Something with the evidence is wrong and the evidence is to be thrown out. This includes irrelevance or corrupt security.
	2. <U>Free Movement-</U> The defendant is to be kept unrestrained before and during the trial.
	3. <U>Subpoena Witness-</U> If the defense presents good reasons for needing a witness but said person fails to cooperate then a subpoena is issued.
	4. <U>Drop the Charges-</U> Not enough evidence is presented for a trial so the charges are to be dropped. The FT CAN RETRY but the judicial authority must carefully reexamine the new evidence.
	5. <U>Declare Incompetent-</U> The defendant is insane. Once this is granted a medical official is to examine the patient. If they are indeed insane, they are to be placed under care of the medical staff until they are deemed competent to stand trial.
	<br>ALL PARTIES MOVE TO A COURTROOM
	<B>Pre-Trial Hearings:</B>
	A judicial authority and the 2 sides are to meet in the trial room. NO ONE ELSE BESIDES A SECURITY DETAIL IS TO BE PRESENT. The defense submits a plea. If the plea is guilty, then proceed directly to sentencing phase. Now the sides each present their motions to the judicial authority. They rule on them. Each side can debate each motion. Then the judicial authority gets a list of crew members. They first get a chance to look at them all and pick out acceptable and available jurors. Those jurors are then called over. Each side can ask a few questions and dismiss jurors they find too biased. HOWEVER before dismissal the judicial authority MUST agree to the reasoning.
	<br><B>The Trial:</B>
	The trial has three phases.
	1. <B>Opening Arguments</B>- Each side can give a short speech. They may not present ANY evidence.
	2. <B>Witness Calling/Evidence Presentation</B>- The prosecution goes first and is able to call the witnesses on their approved list in any order. They can recall them if necessary. During the questioning, the lawyer may use evidence alongside questions to help prove a point. After each witness, the other side has a chance to cross-examine. After both sides are done questioning a witness, the prosecution can present another or recall one (even the EXACT same one again!). After prosecution is done, the defense can call witnesses. After the initial cases are presented, both sides are free to call witnesses on either list.
	Once both sides are done calling witnesses, we move onto the next phase.
	3. <B>Closing Arguments</B>- Same as opening.
	The jury then deliberates IN PRIVATE. THEY MUST ALL AGREE on a verdict. REMEMBER: They mix between some charges being guilty and others not guilty (i.e. if you supposedly killed someone with a gun, and you unfortunately picked up a gun without authorization, then you CAN be found not guilty of murder BUT guilty of possession of illegal weaponry.). Once they have agreed, they present their verdict. If the jury votes in majority that they will be unable to unanimously reach a verdict, they call a deadlocked jury and the case restarts at Pre-Trial phase with an entirely new set of jurors.
	<br><B>Sentencing Phase:</B>
	If the death penalty was sought (you MUST have gone through a trial for death penalty) then skip to the second part.
	I. Each side can present more evidence/witnesses in any order. The prosecution is to submit a suggested penalty. After all the sides are done, the judicial authority is to give a sentence.
	II. The jury stays and does the same thing as I. Their sole job is to determine if the death penalty is applicable. If not, then the judge selects a sentence.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe trial is now complete. Security then executes the sentence and adds the applicable convictions to the person's record.

	<br>Hello there, proud operator of an NT-Sec Prisoner Rehabilitation Center.  A solution to rising crime rates and falling productivity, these facilities are specifically designed for the safe, productive imprisonment of your most dangerous criminals.
	<br>To press a long-term prisoner into the service of the station, replace their equipment with prisoners' garb at one of the prison lockers, as per normal operating procedure.  Before assigning a prisoner their ID, insert the ID into a prisoner management console and assign the prisoner a quota, based on the severity of their crime.
	A single sheet of most materials produces five points for the prisoner, and points can be expected to be produced at a rate of about 100 per minute, though punishments as severe as forced labor should be reserved for serious crimes of sentences not less than five minutes long.
	Once you have prepared the prisoner, place them in the secure northern half of the labor shuttle, and send them to the station.  Once they meet their quota by feeding sheets to the stacker, they will be allowed to return to the station, and will be able to open the secure door to the prisoner release area.
	<br>In the case of dangerous prisoners, surveillance may be needed. To that end, there is a prisoner monitoring room on the mining station, equipped with a remote flasher and a lockdown button.  The mine itself is patrolled by a securibot, so the nearby security records console can also be used to secure hostile prisoners on the mine."}

	<br> Hey there, it's me, Josh. You know who I am, I hired you! Anyways, you're probably wondering why this gas station is themed after lizards. I just think they're pretty neat! I wish I was a lizard.
	<br>
	<br> Anywho, it's also called "The Lizard's Gas" for another reason... <i> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed. </i> Yeah, I got a buddy who's a fucking wizard with growing weed.
	<br>
	<br> Anyways, I thought that when I bought this fuckin' joint (ha ha get it weed), that I should probably sell, y'know, <i> gas? </i> Get it? Gas. Like weed. God, I love weed so much.
	<br>
	<br> Back to my point, feel free to sling some of this weed on the side. I don't know what jurisdiction we're in, but it's fine. I know it's fine. I probably wouldn't care. Weed.
	<br>
	<br> Yep, all of my weed is in this box. Enjoy! I'm going to go home and hit a gram of my THC (that's like, concentrated weed) Pen (for weed). I'll be back, and those hemp ropes I tied should stay...
	<br>
	<br> Make sure you turn that SMES off before you leave! It needs to be on for everything to function, but there's only so much charge left and I can't afford a new one!

	<br> Best of luck!

Greetings operative.

<br>As you may be aware, since your financial backers do not wish to provide our collective enemies access to any trace of you or your physical form, we've had to augment
you with an explosive located in the base of your neck: a microbomb implant. This implant activates a blood-based explosive the moment your heart stops beating, destroying all
evidence of your physical body and brain, eradicating you permanently so those freaks at Nanotrasen can't interrogate your brain. Or worse, clone you and mindwipe you.
We much prefer you free to die red than a slave to the corporation. I'm sure you agree. <B><i>Right, comrade?</i></B>
<br>
<br>Now, don't fret. While this is beneficial for our needs, we understand that operatives sometimes would prefer themselves to be able to have more
precise control over their own total oblivion. This is why our microbomb implants come equipped with a few useful features.
<br>
<br><B>Firstly, the bombs autodetonation is neutralized by atropine</B>. So, if you have atropine in your system when your heart stops beating, your implant does not automatically detonate.
This is why you are equipped with an atropine autoinjector. If you see a fellow operative fall, immediately inject them with the autoinjector before they expire. If you're lucky,
you'll potentially be able to recover their body for revival. Atropine also just so happens to be an incredibly powerful stablizer, so maybe use it before you fall. You might just
be able to save yourself for a few seconds and keep fighting.
<br>
<br><B>Secondly, the bomb can be activated posthumously</B>. There is a small onboard, low-level AI built into the microbomb. Based on a series of arbitrary factors, the bomb can still be activated
despite the presence of atropine by releasing a failsafe vial of monkey blood (notoriously volatile), the timing of which is determined by the onboard AI.
<br>The only factor is whether or not, and forgive me for what I'm about to write, your 'animating spirit' still resides within your body to guide the AI and activate the bomb manually.
<br>Please, do not ask your fellow operatives what this means.
<br>
<br>They'll probably say something absurd like <B>'your ghost needs to still be in your body to use the microbomb'</B>. That's stupid, do not listen to these ridiculous assertions. It is likely Nanotrasen propaganda.
<br>
<br>Ghosts are not real. Necromancy is <B>bullshit</B>.
<br>
<br>Anyway, best of luck on your mission, operative.
