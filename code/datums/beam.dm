/** # Beam Datum and Effect
 * **IF YOU ARE LAZY AND DO NOT WANT TO READ, GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE AND USE THAT PROC!**
 *
 * This is the beam datum! It's a really neat effect for the game in drawing a line from one atom to another.
 * It has two parts:
 * The datum itself which manages redrawing the beam to constantly keep it pointing from the origin to the target.
 * The effect which is what the beams are made out of. They're placed in a line from the origin to target, rotated towards the target and snipped off at the end.
 * These effects are kept in a list and constantly created and destroyed (hence the proc names draw and reset, reset destroying all effects and draw creating more.)
 *
 * You can add more special effects to the beam itself by changing what the drawn beam effects do. For example you can make a vine that pricks people by making the beam_type
 * include a crossed proc that damages the crosser. Examples in venus_human_trap.dm

 * This is what you use to start a beam. Example: origin.Beam(target, args). **Store the return of this proc if you don't set maxdist or time, you need it to delete the beam.**
 *
 * Unless you're making a custom beam effect (see the beam_type argument), you won't actually have to mess with any other procs. Make sure you store the return of this Proc, you'll need it
 * to kill the beam.
 * **Arguments:**
 * BeamTarget: Where you're beaming from. Where do you get origin? You didn't read the docs, fuck you.
 * icon_state: What the beam's icon_state is. The datum effect isn't the ebeam object, it doesn't hold any icon and isn't type dependent.
 * icon: What the beam's icon file is. Don't change this, man. All beam icons should be in beam.dmi anyways.
 * maxdistance: how far the beam will go before stopping itself. Used mainly for two things: preventing lag if the beam may go in that direction and setting a range to abilities that use beams.
 * beam_type: The type of your custom beam. This is for adding other wacky stuff for your beam only. Most likely, you won't (and shouldn't) change it.
