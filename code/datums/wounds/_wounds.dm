/*
	Wounds are specific medical complications that can arise and be applied to (currently) carbons, with a focus on humans. All of the code for and related to this is heavily WIP,
	and the documentation will be slanted towards explaining what each part/piece is leading up to, until such a time as I finish the core implementations. The original design doc
	can be found at https://hackmd.io/@Ryll/r1lb4SOwU

	Wounds are datums that operate like a mix of diseases, brain traumas, and components, and are applied to a /obj/item/bodypart (preferably attached to a carbon) when they take large spikes of damage
	or under other certain conditions (thrown hard against a wall, sustained exposure to plasma fire, etc). Wounds are categorized by the three following criteria:
		1. Severity: Either MODERATE, SEVERE, or CRITICAL. See the hackmd for more details
		2. Viable zones: What body parts the wound is applicable to. Generic wounds like broken bones and severe burns can apply to every zone, but you may want to add special wounds for certain limbs
			like a twisted ankle for legs only, or open air exposure of the organs for particularly gruesome chest wounds. Wounds should be able to function for every zone they are marked viable for.
		3. Damage type: Currently either BRUTE or BURN. Again, see the hackmd for a breakdown of my plans for each type.

	When a body part suffers enough damage to get a wound, the severity (determined by a roll or something, worse damage leading to worse wounds), affected limb, and damage type sustained are factored into
	deciding what specific wound will be applied. I'd like to have a few different types of wounds for at least some of the choices, but I'm just doing rough generals for now. Expect polishing
