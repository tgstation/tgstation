/**
 * Causes weather to occur on a z level in certain area types

 * The effects of weather occur across an entire z-level. For instance, lavaland has periodic ash storms that scorch most unprotected creatures.
 * Weather always occurs on different z levels at different times, regardless of weather type.
 * Can have custom durations, targets, and can automatically protect indoor areas.
