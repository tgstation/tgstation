/**
 * ## Personality Singleton
 *
 * Contains information about a personaility.
 *
 * A personality is designed to be a small modifier to the way a mob reacts to moodlets or world events.
 *
 * For example, a mob with the Callous personality would not receive a positive moodlet for saving someone's life.
 *
 * They're not meant to be full blown quirks that hold state and such.
 * If you NEED state, consider making a quirk, or moving your behavior into a component the personality applies.
