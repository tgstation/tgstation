<p>The intent of this folder categorization is to be able to quickly reference what are intended to be in-game networks, vs what is logically networked inside the code.</p>
<p>Knowing what is meant to be conceptually working off of an in-game network serves as guidance for adding or modifying features or fixing oversights and/or bugs.</p>
<p>For instance, the radio jammer only affecting headsets and suit sensors could benefit from a shorthand awareness of other systems that are represented as a network, such as research. Using the radio jammer near a server or fabricator could cause it to sever its link to the supply silo or the research web.
This example is presented only as such, and not a recommendation on any new features or balance changes.</p></td></tr></table></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/tree/cd8d3cfc6452876b3929e640c2fd6fdbfee7f93f">cd8d3cf</a> (master) — <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.11.0</a></footer></body></html>
