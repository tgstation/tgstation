/**
 * SSverb_manager, a subsystem that runs every tick and runs through its entire queue without yielding like SSinput.
 * this exists because of how the byond tick works and where user inputted verbs are put within it.
 *
 * see TICK_ORDER.md for more info on how the byond tick is structured.
 *
 * The way the MC allots its time is via TICK_LIMIT_RUNNING, it simply subtracts the cost of SendMaps (MAPTICK_LAST_INTERNAL_TICK_USAGE)
 * plus TICK_BYOND_RESERVE from the tick and uses up to that amount of time (minus the percentage of the tick used by the time it executes subsystems)
 * on subsystems running cool things like atmospherics or Life or SSInput or whatever.
 *
 * Without this subsystem, verbs are likely to cause overtime if the MC uses all of the time it has allotted for itself in the tick, and SendMaps
 * uses as much as its expected to, and an expensive verb ends up executing that tick. This is because the MC is completely blind to the cost of
 * verbs, it can't account for it at all. The only chance for verbs to not cause overtime in a tick where the MC used as much of the tick
 * as it allotted itself and where SendMaps costed as much as it was expected to is if the verb(s) take less than TICK_BYOND_RESERVE percent of
 * the tick, which isn't much. Not to mention if SendMaps takes more than 30% of the tick and the MC forces itself to take at least 70% of the
 * normal tick duration which causes ticks to naturally overrun even in the absence of verbs.
 *
 * With this subsystem, the MC can account for the cost of verbs and thus stop major overruns of ticks. This means that the most important subsystems
 * like SSinput can start at the same time they were supposed to, leading to a smoother experience for the player since ticks aren't riddled with
 * minor hangs over and over again.
