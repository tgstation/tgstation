/**
 * # Spatial Grid
 *
 * a gamewide grid of spatial_grid_cell datums, each "covering" [SPATIAL_GRID_CELLSIZE] ^ 2 turfs.
 * each spatial_grid_cell datum stores information about what is inside its covered area, so that searches through that area dont have to literally search
 * through all turfs themselves to know what is within it since view() calls are expensive, and so is iterating through stuff you dont want.
 * this allows you to only go through lists of what you want very cheaply.
 *
 * you can also register to objects entering and leaving a spatial cell, this allows you to do things like stay idle until a player enters, so you wont
 * have to use expensive view() calls or iteratite over the global list of players and call get_dist() on every one. which is fineish for a few things, but is
 * k * n operations for k objects iterating through n players.
 *
 * currently this system is only designed for searching for relatively uncommon things, small subsets of /atom/movable.
 * dont add stupid shit to the cells please, keep the information that the cells store to things that need to be searched for often
 *
 * The system currently implements two different "classes" of spatial type
 *
 * The first exists to support important_recursive_contents.
 * So if a client is inside a locker and the locker crosses a boundary, you'll still get a signal from the spatial grid.
 * These types are [SPATIAL_GRID_CONTENTS_TYPE_HEARING] and [SPATIAL_GRID_CONTENTS_TYPE_CLIENTS]
 *
 * The second pattern is more paired down, and supports more wide use.
 * Rather then the object and anything the object is in being sensitive, it's limited to just the object itself
 * Currently only [SPATIAL_GRID_CONTENTS_TYPE_ATMOS] uses this pattern. This is because it's far more common, and so worth optimizing
 *
