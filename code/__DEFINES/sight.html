can see all mobs, no matter what

can see self, no matter what
can see infra-red objects (different sort of luminosity, essentially a copy of it, one we do not use)
if an object is located on an unlit area, but some of its pixels are
in a lit area (via pixel_x,y or smooth movement), can see those pixels
can see through opaque objects
render dark tiles as blackness (Note, this basically means we draw dark tiles to plane 0)
we can then hijack that plane with a plane master, and start drawing it anywhere we want
NOTE: this does not function with the SIDE_MAP map format. So we can't. :(
Bitfield of sight flags that show THINGS but no lighting
Since lighting is an underlay on turfs, this is everything but that</td></tr></table><h2 id="define">Define Details</h2><h3 id="define/SEE_AVOID_TURF_BLACKNESS"><aside class="declaration">#define </aside>SEE_AVOID_TURF_BLACKNESS <a href="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/c41b333c9bc46606d2c5d5b517f7836d5953fbfd/code/__DEFINES/sight.dm#L62"><img src="git.png" width="16" height="16" title="code/__DEFINES/sight.dm 62"></a></h3><p>can't see anything
