 * Arguments:
 * * volume: The initial volume of the sound being played
 * * max_distance: The range of the sound in tiles (technically not real max distance since the furthest areas gets pruned due to SOUND_AUDIBLE_VOLUME_MIN)
 * * falloff_distance: Distance at which falloff begins. Sound is at peak volume (in regards to falloff) aslong as it is in this range.
 * * falloff_exponent: Rate of falloff for the audio. Higher means quicker drop to low volume. Should generally be over 1 to indicate a quick dive to 0 rather than a slow dive.
 * Returns: The max distance of a sound based on audible volume range
