/**
 * Searches through all wounds for any of proper type, series, and biostate, and then returns a single one via pickweight.
 * Is able to discern between, say, a flesh slash wound, and a metallic slash wound, and will return the respective one for the provided limb.
 *
 * The severity_max and severity_pick_mode args mostly exist in case you want a wound in a series that may not have your ideal severity wound, as it lets you
 * essentially set a "fallback", where if your ideal wound doesnt exist, it'll still return something, trying to get closest to your ideal severity.
 *
 * Generally speaking, if you want a critical/severe/moderate wound, you should set severity_min to WOUND_SEVERITY_MODERATE, severity_max to your ideal wound,
 * and severity_pick_mode to WOUND_PICK_HIGHEST_SEVERITY - UNLESS you for some reason want the LOWEST severity, in which case you should set
 * severity_max to the highest wound you're willing to tolerate, and severity_pick_mode to WOUND_PICK_LOWEST_SEVERITY.
 *
 * Args:
 * * list/wounding_types: A list of wounding_types. Only wounds that accept these wound types will be considered.
 * * obj/item/bodypart/part: The limb we are considering. Extremely important for biostates.
 * * severity_min: The minimum wound severity we will search for.
 * * severity_max = severity_min: The maximum wound severity we will search for.
 * * severity_pick_mode = WOUND_PICK_HIGHEST_SEVERITY: The "pick mode" we will use when considering multiple wounds of acceptable severity. See the above defines.
 * * random_roll = TRUE: If this is considered a "random" consideration. If true, only wounds that can be randomly generated will be considered.
 * * duplicates_allowed = FALSE: If exact duplicates of a given wound on part are tolerated. Useful for simply getting a path and not instantiating.
 * * care_about_existing_wounds = TRUE: If we iterate over wounds to see if any are above or at a given wounds severity, and disregard it if any are. Useful for simply getting a path and not instantiating.
 *
 * Returns:
 * A randomly picked wound typepath meeting all the above criteria and being applicable to the part's biotype - or null if there were none.
