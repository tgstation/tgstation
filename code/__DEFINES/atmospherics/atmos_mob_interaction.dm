/** liters in a normal breath. note that breaths are taken once every 4 life ticks, which is 8 seconds
 * Addendum for people tweaking this value in the future.
 * Because o2 tank release values/human o2 requirements are very strictly set to the same pressure, small errors can cause breakage
 * This comes from QUANTIZE being used in /datum/gas_mixture.remove(), forming a slight sawtooth pattern of the added/removed gas, centered on the actual pressure
 * Changing BREATH_VOLUME can set us on the lower half of this sawtooth, making humans unable to breath at standard pressure.
 * There's no good way I can come up with to hardcode a fix for this. So if you're going to change this variable
 * graph the functions that describe how it is used/how it interacts with breath code, and pick something on the upper half of the sawtooth
