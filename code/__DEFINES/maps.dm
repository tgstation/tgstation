/*
The /tg/ codebase allows mixing of hardcoded and dynamically-loaded Z-levels.
Z-levels can be reordered as desired and their properties are set by "traits".
See code/datums/map_config.dm for how a particular station's traits may be chosen.
The list DEFAULT_MAP_TRAITS at the bottom of this file should correspond to
the maps that are hardcoded, as set in _maps/_basemap.dm. SSmapping is
responsible for loading every non-hardcoded Z-level.

As of April 26th, 2022, the typical Z-levels for a single-level station are:
1: CentCom
2: Station
3-4: Randomized Space (Ruins)
5: Mining
6-11: Randomized Space (Ruins)
12: Transit/Reserved Space

However, if away missions are enabled:
12: Away Mission
13: Transit/Reserved Space

Multi-Z stations are supported and Multi-Z mining and away missions would
require only minor tweaks. They also handle their Z-Levels differently on their
own case by case basis.

This information will absolutely date quickly with how we handle Z-Levels, and will
continue to handle them in the future. Currently, you can go into the Debug tab
of your stat-panel (in game) and hit "Mapping verbs - Enable". You will then get a new tab
called "Mapping", as well as access to the verb "Debug-Z-Levels". Although the information
presented in this comment is factual for the time it was written for, it's ill-advised
to trust the words presented within.

We also provide this information to you so that you can have an at-a-glance look at how
Z-Levels are arranged. It is extremely ill-advised to ever use the location of a Z-Level
to assign traits to it or use it in coding. Use Z-Traits (ZTRAITs) for these.

If you want to start toying around with Z-Levels, do not take these words for fact.
Always compile, always use that verb, and always make sure that it works for what you want to do.
