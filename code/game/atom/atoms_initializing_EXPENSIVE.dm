 * The primary method that objects are setup in SS13 with

 * we don't use New as we have better control over when this is called and we can choose
 * to delay calls or hook other logic in and so forth
 *
 * During roundstart map parsing, atoms are queued for initialization in the base atom/New(),
 * After the map has loaded, then Initialize is called on all atoms one by one. NB: this
 * is also true for loading map templates as well, so they don't Initialize until all objects
 * in the map file are parsed and present in the world
 *
 * If you're creating an object at any point after SSInit has run then this proc will be
 * immediately be called from New.
 *
 * mapload: This parameter is true if the atom being loaded is either being initialized during
 * the Atom subsystem initialization, or if the atom is being loaded from the map template.
 * If the item is being created at runtime any time after the Atom subsystem is initialized then
 * it's false.
 *
 * The mapload argument occupies the same position as loc when Initialize() is called by New().
 * loc will no longer be needed after it passed New(), and thus it is being overwritten
 * with mapload at the end of atom/New() before this proc (atom/Initialize()) is called.
 *
 * You must always call the parent of this proc, otherwise failures will occur as the item
 * will not be seen as initialized (this can lead to all sorts of strange behaviour, like
 * the item being completely unclickable)
 *
 * You must not sleep in this proc, or any subprocs
 *
 * Any parameters from new are passed through (excluding loc), naturally if you're loading from a map
 * there are no other arguments
 *
 * Must return an [initialization hint][INITIALIZE_HINT_NORMAL] or a runtime will occur.
 *
 * Note: the following functions don't call the base for optimization and must copypasta handling:
 * * [/turf/proc/Initialize]
 * * [/turf/open/space/proc/Initialize]
