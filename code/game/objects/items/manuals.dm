				<h3>Growing Humans</h3>

				Why would you want to grow humans? Well, I'm expecting most readers to be in the slave trade, but a few might actually
				want to revive fallen comrades. Growing pod people is actually quite simple:
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>Find a dead person who is in need of revival. </li>
				<li>Take a blood sample with a syringe (samples of their blood taken BEFORE they died will also work). </li>
				<li>Inject a packet of replica pod seeds (which can be acquired by either mutating cabbages into replica pods (and then harvesting said replica pods) or by purchasing them from certain corporate entities) with the blood sample. </li>
				<li>It is imperative to understand that injecting the replica pod plant with blood AFTER it has been planted WILL NOT WORK; you have to inject the SEED PACKET, NOT the TRAY. </li>
				<li>Plant the seeds. </li>
				<li>Tend to the replica pod's water and nutrition levels until it is time to harvest the podcloned humanoid. </li>
				<li>Note that if the corpse's mind (or spirit, or soul, or whatever the hell your local chaplain calls it) is already in a new body or has left this plane of existence entirely, you will just receive seed packets upon harvesting the replica pod plant, not a podperson. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				It really is that easy! Good luck!

				<h1>Food for Dummies</h1>
				Here is a guide on basic food recipes and also how to not poison your customers accidentally.


				<h2>Basic ingredients preparation:</h2>

				<b>Dough:</b> 10u water + 15u flour for simple dough.<br>
				15u egg yolk + 15u flour + 5u sugar for cake batter.<br>
				Doughs can be transformed by using a knife and rolling pin.<br>
				All doughs can be microwaved.<br>
				<b>Bowl:</b> Add water to it for soup preparation.<br>
				<b>Meat:</b> Microwave it, process it, slice it into microwavable cutlets with your knife, or use it raw.<br>
				<b>Cheese:</b> Add 5u universal enzyme (catalyst) to milk and soy milk to prepare cheese (sliceable) and tofu.<br>
				<b>Rice:</b> Mix 10u rice with 10u water in a bowl then microwave it.

				<h2>Custom food:</h2>
				Add ingredients to a base item to prepare a custom meal.<br>
				The bases are:<br>
				- bun (burger)<br>
				- breadslices(sandwich)<br>
				- plain bread<br>
				- plain pie<br>
				- vanilla cake<br>
				- empty bowl (salad)<br>
				- bowl with 10u water (soup)<br>
				- boiled spaghetti<br>
				- pizza bread<br>
				- metal rod (kebab)

				<h2>Table Craft:</h2>
				Put ingredients on table, then click and drag the table onto yourself to see what recipes you can prepare.

				<h2>Microwave:</h2>
				Use it to cook or boil food ingredients (meats, doughs, egg, spaghetti, donkpocket, etc...).
				It can cook multiple items at once.

				<h2>Processor:</h2>
				Use it to process certain ingredients (meat into meatballs, doughslice into spaghetti, potato into fries,etc...)

				<h2>Gibber:</h2>
				Stuff an animal in it to grind it into meat.

				<h2>Meat spike:</h2>
				Stick an animal on it then begin collecting its meat.


				<h2>Example recipes:</h2>
				<b>Vanilla Cake</b>: Microwave cake batter.<br>
				<b>Burger:</b> 1 bun + 1 meat steak<br>
				<b>Bread:</b> Microwave dough.<br>
				<b>Waffles:</b> 2 pastry base<br>
				<b>Popcorn:</b> Microwave corn.<br>
				<b>Meat Steak:</b> Microwave meat.<br>
				<b>Meat Pie:</b> 1 plain pie + 1u black pepper + 1u salt + 2 meat cutlets<br>
				<b>Boiled Spagetti:</b> Microwave spaghetti.<br>
				<b>Donuts:</b> 1u sugar + 1 pastry base<br>
				<b>Fries:</b> Process potato.

				<h2>Sharing your food:</h2>
				You can put your meals on your kitchen counter or load them in the snack vending machines.

			Nuclear Explosives 101:<br>
			Hello and thank you for choosing the Syndicate for your nuclear information needs.<br>
			Today's crash course will deal with the operation of a Fusion Class Nanotrasen made Nuclear Device.<br>
			First and foremost, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL THE BOMB IS IN PLACE.<br>
			Pressing any button on the compacted bomb will cause it to extend and bolt itself into place.<br>
			If this is done to unbolt it one must completely log in which at this time may not be possible.<br>
			To make the nuclear device functional:<br>
			<li>Place the nuclear device in the designated detonation zone.</li>
			<li>Extend and anchor the nuclear device from its interface.</li>
			<li>Insert the nuclear authorisation disk into slot.</li>
			<li>Type numeric authorisation code into the keypad. This should have been provided. Note: If you make a mistake press R to reset the device.
			<li>Press the E button to log onto the device.</li>
			You now have activated the device. To deactivate the buttons at anytime for example when you've already prepped the bomb for detonation	remove the auth disk OR press the R on the keypad.<br>
			Now the bomb CAN ONLY be detonated using the timer. Manual detonation is not an option.<br>
			Note: Nanotrasen is a pain in the neck.<br>
			Toggle off the SAFETY.<br>
			Note: You wouldn't believe how many Syndicate Operatives with doctorates have forgotten this step.<br>
			So use the - - and + + to set a det time between 5 seconds and 10 minutes.<br>
			Then press the timer toggle button to start the countdown.<br>
			Now remove the auth. disk so that the buttons deactivate.<br>
			Note: THE BOMB IS STILL SET AND WILL DETONATE<br>
			Now before you remove the disk if you need to move the bomb you can:<br>
			Toggle off the anchor, move it, and re-anchor.<br><br>
			Good luck. Remember the order:<br>
			<b>Disk, Code, Safety, Timer, Disk, RUN!</b><br>
			Intelligence Analysts believe that normal Nanotrasen procedure is for the Captain to secure the nuclear authorisation disk.<br>
			Good luck!
