/**
 * This file contains the stuff you need for using JPS (Jump Point Search) pathing, an alternative to A* that skips
 * over large numbers of uninteresting tiles resulting in much quicker pathfinding solutions. Mind that diagonals
 * cost the same as cardinal moves currently, so paths may look a bit strange, but should still be optimal.
 */

/**
 * This is the proc you use whenever you want to have pathfinding more complex than "try stepping towards the thing".
 * If no path was found, returns an empty list, which is important for bots like medibots who expect an empty list rather than nothing.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * caller: The movable atom that's trying to find the path
 * * end: What we're trying to path to. It doesn't matter if this is a turf or some other atom, we're gonna just path to the turf it's on anyway
 * * max_distance: The maximum number of steps we can take in a given path to search (default: 30, 0 = infinite)
 * * mintargetdistance: Minimum distance to the target before path returns, could be used to get near a target, but not right to it - for an AI mob with a gun, for example.
 * * id: An ID card representing what access we have and what doors we can open. Its location relative to the pathing atom is irrelevant
 * * simulated_only: Whether we consider turfs without atmos simulation (AKA do we want to ignore space)
 * * exclude: If we want to avoid a specific turf, like if we're a mulebot who already got blocked by some turf
 * * skip_first: Whether or not to delete the first item in the path. This would be done because the first item is the starting tile, which can break movement for some creatures.
