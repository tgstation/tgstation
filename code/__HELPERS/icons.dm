IconProcs README

A BYOND library for manipulating icons and colors

by Lummox JR

version 1.0

The IconProcs library was made to make a lot of common icon operations much easier. BYOND's icon manipulation
routines are very capable but some of the advanced capabilities like using alpha transparency can be unintuitive to beginners.

CHANGING ICONS

Several new procs have been added to the /icon datum to simplify working with icons. To use them,
remember you first need to setup an /icon var like so:

GLOBAL_DATUM_INIT(my_icon, /icon, new('iconfile.dmi'))

icon/ChangeOpacity(amount = 1)
	A very common operation in DM is to try to make an icon more or less transparent. Making an icon more
	transparent is usually much easier than making it less so, however. This proc basically is a frontend
	for MapColors() which can change opacity any way you like, in much the same way that SetIntensity()
	can make an icon lighter or darker. If amount is 0.5, the opacity of the icon will be cut in half.
	If amount is 2, opacity is doubled and anything more than half-opaque will become fully opaque.
icon/GrayScale()
	Converts the icon to grayscale instead of a fully colored icon. Alpha values are left intact.
icon/ColorTone(tone)
	Similar to GrayScale(), this proc converts the icon to a range of black -> tone -> white, where tone is an
	RGB color (its alpha is ignored). This can be used to create a sepia tone or similar effect.
	See also the global ColorTone() proc.
icon/MinColors(icon)
	The icon is blended with a second icon where the minimum of each RGB pixel is the result.
	Transparency may increase, as if the icons were blended with ICON_ADD. You may supply a color in place of an icon.
icon/MaxColors(icon)
	The icon is blended with a second icon where the maximum of each RGB pixel is the result.
	Opacity may increase, as if the icons were blended with ICON_OR. You may supply a color in place of an icon.
icon/Opaque(background = COLOR_BLACK)
	All alpha values are set to 255 throughout the icon. Transparent pixels become black, or whatever background color you specify.
icon/BecomeAlphaMask()
	You can convert a simple grayscale icon into an alpha mask to use with other icons very easily with this proc.
	The black parts become transparent, the white parts stay white, and anything in between becomes a translucent shade of white.
icon/AddAlphaMask(mask)
	The alpha values of the mask icon will be blended with the current icon. Anywhere the mask is opaque,
	the current icon is untouched. Anywhere the mask is transparent, the current icon becomes transparent.
	Where the mask is translucent, the current icon becomes more transparent.
icon/UseAlphaMask(mask, mode)
	Sometimes you may want to take the alpha values from one icon and use them on a different icon.
	This proc will do that. Just supply the icon whose alpha mask you want to use, and src will change
	so it has the same colors as before but uses the mask for opacity.

COLOR MANAGEMENT AND HSV

RGB isn't the only way to represent color. Sometimes it's more useful to work with a model called HSV, which stands for hue, saturation, and value.

	* The hue of a color describes where it is along the color wheel. It goes from red to yellow to green to
	cyan to blue to magenta and back to red.
	* The saturation of a color is how much color is in it. A color with low saturation will be more gray,
	and with no saturation at all it is a shade of gray.
	* The value of a color determines how bright it is. A high-value color is vivid, moderate value is dark,
	and no value at all is black.

While rgb is typically stored in the #rrggbb" format (with optional "aa" on the end), HSV never needs to be displayed.
Most procs that work in HSV "space" will simply accept RGB inputs and convert them in place using rgb2num(color, space = COLORSPACE_HSV).

That said, if you want to manually modify these values rgb2hsv() will hand you back a list in the format list(hue, saturation, value, alpha).
Converting back is simple, just a hsv2rgb(hsv) call

Hue ranges from 0 to 360 (it's in degrees of a color wheel)
Saturation ranges from 0 to 100
Value ranges from 0 to 100

Knowing this, you can figure out that red is list(0, 100, 100) in HSV format, which is hue 0 (red), saturation 100 (as colorful as possible),
value 255 (as bright as possible). Green is list(120, 100, 100) and blue is list(240, 100, 100).

It is worth noting that while we do not have helpers for them currently, these same ideas apply to all of byond's color spaces
HSV (hue saturation value), HSL (hue satriation luminosity) and HCY (hue chroma luminosity)

Here are some procs you can use for color management:

BlendRGB(rgb1, rgb2, amount)
	Blends between two RGB or RGBA colors using regular RGB blending. If amount is 0, the first color is the result;
	if 1, the second color is the result. 0.5 produces an average of the two. Values outside the 0 to 1 range are allowed as well.
	Returns an RGB or RGBA string
BlendHSV(rgb1, rgb2, amount)
	Blends between two RGB or RGBA colors using HSV blending, which tends to produce nicer results than regular RGB
	blending because the brightness of the color is left intact. If amount is 0, the first color is the result; if 1,
	the second color is the result. 0.5 produces an average of the two. Values outside the 0 to 1 range are allowed as well.
	Returns an RGB or RGBA string
HueToAngle(hue)
	Converts a hue to an angle range of 0 to 360. Angle 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
AngleToHue(hue)
	Converts an angle to a hue in the valid range.
RotateHue(rgb, angle)
	Takes an RGB or RGBA value and rotates the hue forward through red, green, and blue by an angle from 0 to 360.
	(Rotating red by 60° produces yellow.)
	Returns an RGB or RGBA string
GrayScale(rgb)
	Takes an RGB or RGBA color and converts it to grayscale. Returns an RGB or RGBA string.
ColorTone(rgb, tone)
	Similar to GrayScale(), this proc converts an RGB or RGBA color to a range of black -> tone -> white instead of
	using strict shades of gray. The tone value is an RGB color; any alpha value is ignored.

 * Because BYOND's documentation is hot garbage and I don't trust anyone to actually
 * figure this out on their own without sinking countless hours into it. Yes, it's that
 * simple, now enjoy.
 *
 * But why not use filters?
 *
 * Filters do not allow for masks that are not the exact same on every dir. An example of a
 * need for that can be found in [/proc/generate_left_leg_mask()].
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * icon_to_mask - The icon file you want to generate an alpha mask out of.
 * * icon_state_to_mask - The specific icon_state you want to generate an alpha mask out of.
 *
 * Returns an `/icon` that is the alpha mask of the provided icon and icon_state.
