Radiation is performed by collecting all radiatables within the max range (0 means source only, 1 means adjacent, etc),
then makes their way towards them. A number, starting at 1, is multiplied
by the insulation amounts of whatever is in the way (for example, walls lowering it down).
If this number hits equal or below the threshold, then the target can no longer be irradiated.
If the number is above the threshold, then the chance is the chance that the target will be irradiated.
As a consumer, this means that max_range going up usually means you want to lower the threshold too,
as well as the other way around.
If max_range is high, but threshold is too high, then it usually won't reach the source at the max range in time.
If max_range is low, but threshold is too low, then it basically guarantees everyone nearby, even if there's walls
and such in the way, can be irradiated.
You can also pass in a minimum exposure time. If this is set, then this radiation pulse
will not irradiate the source unless they have been around <em>any</em> radioactive source for that
period of time.
The chance to get irradiated diminishes over range, and from objects that block radiation.
Assuming there is nothing in the way, the chance will determine what the chance is to get irradiated from half of max_range.
Example: If chance is equal to 30%, and max_range is equal to 8,
then the chance for a thing to get irradiated is 30% if they are 4 turfs away from the pulse source.</td></tr><tr><th>/proc/<a href="global.html#proc/get_perceived_radiation_danger">get_perceived_radiation_danger</a></th><td>Gets the perceived &quot;danger&quot; of radiation pulse, given the threshold to the target.
