If no path was found, returns an empty list, which is important for bots like medibots who expect an empty list rather than nothing.
It will yield until a path is returned, using magic</td></tr><tr><th>/proc/<a href="global.html#proc/get_swarm_path_to">get_swarm_path_to</a></th><td>POTENTIALLY cheaper version of get_path_to
This proc generates a path map for the end atom's turf, which allows us to cheaply do pathing operations &quot;at&quot; it
Generation is significantly SLOWER then get_path_to, but if many things are/might be pathing at something then it is much faster
Runs the risk of returning an suboptimal or INVALID PATH if the delay between map creation and use is too long</td></tr><tr><th>/proc/<a href="global.html#proc/pathfinding_finished">pathfinding_finished</a></th><td>Uses funny pass by reference bullshit to take the output created by pathfinding, and insert it into a return list
We'll be able to use this return list to tell a sleeping proc to continue execution</td></tr><tr><th><a href="datum/pathfind.html">/datum/pathfind</a></th><td>The datum used to handle the JPS pathfinding, completely self-contained</td></tr><tr><th>/proc/<a href="global.html#proc/remove_clunky_diagonals">remove_clunky_diagonals</a></th><td>Processes a path (list of turfs), removes any diagonal moves that would lead to a weird bump</td></tr><tr><th>/proc/<a href="global.html#proc/remove_diagonals">remove_diagonals</a></th><td>Processes a path (list of turfs), removes any diagonal moves</td></tr><tr><th><a href="datum/can_pass_info.html">/datum/can_pass_info</a></th><td>Holds all information about what an atom can move through
Passed into CanAStarPass to provide context for a pathing attempt</td></tr></table></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/tree/c41b333c9bc46606d2c5d5b517f7836d5953fbfd">c41b333</a> (master) â€” <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.11.0</a></footer></body></html>
