/*

Here's how to use the TGS chat system with configs

send2adminchat is a simple function that broadcasts to all admin channels that are designated in TGS

send2chat is a bit verbose but can be very specific

In TGS3 it will always be sent to all connected designated game chats.

In TGS4+ they use the new tagging system

The second parameter is a string, this string should be read from a config.
What this does is dictate which TGS channels can be sent to.

For example if you have the following channels in tgs4 set up
- Channel 1, Tag: asdf
- Channel 2, Tag: bombay,asdf
- Channel 3, Tag: Hello my name is asdf
- Channel 4, No Tag
- Channel 5, Tag: butts

and you make the call:

send2chat(new /datum/tgs_message_content("I sniff butts"), CONFIG_GET(string/where_to_send_sniff_butts))

and the config option is set like:

WHERE_TO_SEND_SNIFF_BUTTS asdf

It will be sent to channels 1 and 2

Alternatively if you set the config option to just:

WHERE_TO_SEND_SNIFF_BUTTS

it will be sent to all connected chats.
