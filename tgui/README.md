# tgui

## Introduction

tgui is a robust user interface framework of /tg/station.

tgui is very different from most UIs you will encounter in BYOND programming. It
is heavily reliant on Javascript and web technologies as opposed to DM. If you
are familiar with NanoUI (a library which can be found on almost every other
SS13 codebase), tgui should be fairly easy to pick up.

## Learn tgui

People come to tgui from different backgrounds and with different learning
styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope
youâ€™ll find this section helpful.

### Practical Tutorial

If you are completely new to frontend and prefer to **learn by doing**, start
with our [practical tutorial](docs/tutorial-and-examples.md).

### Guides

This project uses React. Take your time to read the guide:

- [React guide](https://react.dev/learn)

If you were already familiar with an older, Ractive-based tgui and want to
translate concepts between old and new tgui, read this
[interface conversion guide](docs/converting-old-tgui-interfaces.md).

## Pre-requisites

If you are using the tooling provided in this repo, everything is included! Feel
free to skip this step.

However, if you want finer control over the installation or build process, you
will need these:

- [Node v22.11+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - **LTS** release is recommended instead of latest
  - **DO NOT install Chocolatey if Node installer asks you to!**
- [Yarn v4.8.1+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
  - Yarn is normally installed with corepack.

## Usage

**Via provided cmd scripts (Windows)**:

- `bin/tgui-build` - Build tgui in production mode and run a full suite of code
  checks.
- `bin/tgui-dev` - Launch a development server.
  - `bin/tgui-dev --reload` - Reload byond cache once.
  - `bin/tgui-dev --debug` - Run server with debug logging enabled.

> To open a CMD or PowerShell window in any open folder, right click **while
> holding Shift** on any free space in the folder, then click on either
> `Open command window here` or `Open PowerShell window here`.

**Via Juke Build (cross-platform(No))**:

- `tools/build/build.sh tgui` - Build tgui in production mode.
- `tools/build/build.sh tgui-dev` - Build tgui in production mode.
  - `tools/build/build.sh tgui-dev --reload` - Reload byond cache once.
  - `tools/build/build.sh tgui-dev --debug` - Run server with debug logging
    enabled.
- `tools/build/build.sh tgui-lint` - Show (and auto-fix) problems with the code.
- `tools/build/build.sh tgui-test` - Run unit and integration tests.
- `tools/build/build.sh tgui-analyze` - Run a bundle analyzer.
- `tools/build/build.sh tgui-clean` - Clean up tgui folder.

> With Juke Build, you can run multiple targets together, e.g.:
>
> ```
> tools/build/build.sh tgui tgui-lint tgui-tsc tgui-test
> ```

**Via Bun (cross-platform)**:

Run `bun install` once to install tgui dependencies.

- `bun tgui:build` - Build tgui in production mode.
  - `bun tgui:build [options]` - Build tgui with custom webpack options.
- `bun tgui:dev` - Launch a development server.
  - `bun tgui:dev --reload` - Reload byond cache once.
  - `bun tgui:dev --debug` - Run server with debug logging enabled.
- `bun tgui:lint` - Show (and auto-fix) problems with the code.
- `bun tgui:tsc` - Check code with TypeScript compiler.
- `bun tgui:test` - Run unit and integration tests.
- `bun tgui:analyze` - Run a bundle analyzer.
- `bun tgfont:build` - Build icon fonts.

## Important Memo

Remember to always run a full build of tgui before submitting a PR, because it
comes with the full suite of CI checks, and runs much faster on your computer
than on GitHub servers. It will save you some time and possibly a few broken
commits! Address the issues that are reported by the tooling as much as
possible, because maintainers will beat you with a ruler and force you to
address them anyway (unless it's a false positive or something unfixable).

## Troubleshooting

**Development server isn't attaching to the game**

Make sure that you have a tgui window open before you run the dev server. Then,
once it's running, you may need to press F5 to refresh the page.

**Development server is crashing**

Make sure path to your working directory does not contain spaces, special
unicode characters, exclamation marks or any other special symbols. If so, move
codebase to a location which does not contain these characters.

**Development server doesn't find my BYOND cache!**

This happens if your Documents folder in Windows has a custom location, for
example in `E:\Libraries\Documents`. Development server tries its best to find
this non-standard location (searches for a Windows Registry key), but it can
fail. You have to run the dev server with an additional environmental variable,
with a full path to BYOND cache.

```
BYOND_CACHE="E:/Libraries/Documents/BYOND/cache"
```

**Webpack errors out with some cryptic messages!**

> Example: `No template for dependency: PureExpressionDependency`

Webpack stores its cache on disk since tgui 4.3, and it is very sensitive to
build configuration. So if you update webpack, or share the same cache directory
between development and production build, it will start hallucinating.

To fix this kind of problem, run `bin/tgui --clean` and try again.

## Dev Server Tools

When developing with `tgui-dev-server`, you will have access to certain
development only features.

**Debug Logs.** When running server via `bin/tgui --dev --debug`, server will
print debug logs and time spent on rendering. Use this information to optimize
your code, and try to keep re-renders below 16ms.

**Kitchen Sink.** Press `F12` or click the green bug to open the KitchenSink
interface. This interface is a playground to test various tgui components.

**Layout Debugger.** Press `F11` to toggle the _layout debugger_. It will show
outlines of all tgui elements, which makes it easy to understand how everything
comes together, and can reveal certain layout bugs which are not normally
visible.

## Browser Developer Tools

WebView2 is chromium based, so you can access the dev tools much easier than its
predecessor. Simply go to debug tab in your stat panel and click "Allow Browser
Inspection". You can then f12 to open the standard chrome dev tools.

## Project Structure

- `/packages` - Each folder here represents a self-contained Node module.
- `/packages/common` - Helper functions that are used throughout all packages.
- `/packages/tgui/index.ts` - Application entry point.
- `/packages/tgui/interfaces` - Actual in-game interfaces.
- `/packages/tgui/layouts` - Root level UI components, that affect the final
  look and feel of the browser window. These hold various window elements, like
  the titlebar and resize handlers, and control the UI theme.
- `/packages/tgui/routes.ts` - This is where tgui decides which interface to
  pull and render.
- `/packages/tgui/styles/main.scss` - CSS entry point.
- `/packages/tgui/styles/functions.scss` - Useful SASS functions. Stuff like
  `lighten`, `darken`, `luminance` are defined here.
- `/packages/tgui/styles/atomic` - Atomic CSS classes. These are very simple,
  tiny, reusable CSS classes which you can use and combine to change appearance
  of your elements. Keep them small.
- `/packages/tgui/styles/interfaces` - Custom stylesheets for your interfaces.
  Add stylesheets here if you really need a fine control over your UI styles.
- `/packages/tgui/styles/layouts` - Layout-related styles.
- `/packages/tgui/styles/themes` - Contains themes that you can use in tgui.
  Each theme must be registered in `/packages/tgui/index.ts` file.
