Originally made for planets with extreme gravity, Dwarves are much more bulky and short in their physiology; along with various other changes, the most unusual outcome was their biological dependence on alcohol to survive.

The changes resulting from this fusion often times leave no trace of the victims original biology or species, turning them into an entirely plasma-based lifeform. Plasmamen are extremely reactive with oxygenated environments, requiring specialized environment suits to survive in such conditions.

The most popular of these myths is that shadowpeople were once a religious sect of ashlanders on lavaland, who lived in harmony with the dark forces who controlled the underground of the planet. One day, however it may have happened, that these people angered the dark gods of the molten hellscape, whom cursed them to forever live in eternal darkness, lest their forms waste away to the ash they had been born from. Most shadowpeople suffer extreme prejudice, as rumors are largely spread around the frontier about shadowpeople with bladelike appendages that live in the darkness, waiting to prey on the blood of the innocent and to curse everything with unending darkness."

Hosts are extremely aggressive on account of neurological changes imposed by the nanomachines, driven to spread their affliction to anyone who isn't infected.
