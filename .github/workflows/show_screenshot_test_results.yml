# This is a separate workflow so that it can access secrets, which are necessary
# because we need to be able to upload the images and post a comment.
# In the event this workflow fails, the screenshot test results are still
# available as an artifact of the screenshot test comparison workflow itself.
# This simply provides necessary quality of life.
