Please address any outstanding review items and ensure your PR is finished - if both are true, and you have auto-staled anyway, you need to actively ask maintainers (by pinging them in the /tg/station Discord) to (re)review or merge your PR. If no maintainer responds to your request, you may wish to close this PR yourself while you seek maintainer comment, as you will later be able to reopen the PR yourself."
