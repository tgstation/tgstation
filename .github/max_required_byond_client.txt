# Highest byond client version allowed to be required by the byond world. Set to 9999 to disable the check flat out.
# If the compiled world requires clients use a version higher than this, ci will fail.
#   for instance: if this is set to 514, and a pr uses a 515 client feature, an alert will trigger
# If you have to update this number for your pr, you should make it VERY CLEAR in the pr body that you did so.
#   (Requiring clients update to connect to the game server is not something we like to spring on them with no notice,
#   especially for beta builds where the pager/updater won't let them update without additional configuration.)
