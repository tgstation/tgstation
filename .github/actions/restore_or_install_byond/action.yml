# This is a reusable workflow to restore BYOND from a cache, or to install it otherwise.
name: Restore or Install BYOND
description: Attempts to restore a specified BYOND version from cache; if it can't, it installs it.

inputs:
  major:
    description: "The major BYOND version to install. Defaults to the BYOND_MAJOR specified in `dependencies.sh`."
    required: false
    type: string
  minor:
    description: "The minor BYOND version to install. Defaults to the BYOND_MINOR specified in `dependencies.sh`."
    required: false
    type: string

  steps:
    - name: Configure BYOND version from inputs
      if: ${{ inputs.major }}
      shell: bash
      run: |
        echo "BYOND_MAJOR=${{ inputs.major }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

    # The use of `actions/cache/restore` and `actions/cache/save` here is deliberate, as we want to
    # save the BYOND install to a cache as early as possible. If we used just `actions/cache`, it
    # would only attempt to save the cache at the end of a job. This ensures that if a workflow run
    # is cancelled, we already have a cache to restore from.
