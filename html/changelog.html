				<li class="tweak">Pull and Grab are merged together. Pulling stays unchanged. Using an empty hand with grab intent on a mob will pull them. Using an empty hand with grab intent on a mob that you're already pulling will try to upgrade your grip to aggressive grab>neck grab>kill grab. Aggressive grabs no longer stun you, but they act exactly like a handcuff, preventing you from using your hands until you escape the grip. You can break free from the grip by trying to move or using the resist button.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Someone pulling a restrained mob now swap position with them instead of getting blocked by the mob, unable to even push them.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">NOBREATH species (golems, skeletons, abductors, ash walkers, zombies) no longer have or require lungs. They no longer take suffocation/oxyloss damage, cannot give CPR and cannot benefit from CPR. Instead of suffocation damage, during crit they take gradual brute damage.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Wetness updates less often.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Wetness now stacks. Spraying lube over a tile that already has lube, will make the lube take longer to dry. Likewise, dumping 100 units of lube will take longer to dry than if only 10 units were dumped. (lube used to last just as long, regardless of whether it was 1u, or 100u) There is a limit, however, and you can't stack infinite lube.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hotter temperatures cause water to evaporate more quickly. At 100C, water will boil away instantly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">About 5 seconds of wetness are removed from a tile for each unit of drying agent. Absorbant Galoshes remain the most effective method of drying, and dry tiles instantly regardless of wetness.</li>
