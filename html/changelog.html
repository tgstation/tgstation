			<h3 class="author">Intigracy updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds miniature black holes. They function exactly like bags of holding except they fit in pockets. Currently admin spawn only for obvious balance reasons.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.05.08</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Deity Link updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">(BLOB HUD) Blob Overminds now have their own amazing custom HUD. Points gauge on the left, Health gauge on the right. The health gauge start flashing when it gets low.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">(BLOB HUD) Buttons that require more points than you currently have appear grayscale.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">(BLOB HUD) You can always jump back to your core using the small button to the top left. The first 24 special blobs that you've created (not counting the ones that got destroyed) also appear at the top, and you can quickly teleport from one to another by clicking them.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the obsolete and broken Blob random event.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added two new random events, Blob Cluster and Blob Conglomerate. The former is like a medium intensity meteor shower, sending a handful of blobs and node blobs at the station (about as rare as Communications Blackout). The later is a high intensity meteor storm, sending blobs, node blobs, and a few blob cores (I had 2-3 cores per showers during testing. This one is much rarer, one of the rarest events in fact, along with alien infestation and electrical storm). Both events can only trigger after 30 minutes have elapsed.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">Blobs now make sounds when they attack mobs.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added a new meteor gun intended for testing and debugging that lets its user choose which type of meteor to fire.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">As confirmed by dylan, meteors aren't supposed to move from a Z Level to the next. So it's getting fixed at last.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">Added a few new server restart sound files.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Unid updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Vomiting now removes some chemicals from your body.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now vomit into a toilet by standing over it. It's also possible to vomit into a reagent container (like a bucket or a beaker) by either standing over it, or holding it while vomiting. Vomiting into a container partially fills it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pools of vomit now dry over time. You can use a dropper or a syringe on a fresh pool of vomit to extract some of the substance.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.05.07</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Intigracy updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">You may now only turn gas masks into ghetto space helmets, not every kind of mask that covers your face.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Flipping a gas mask that's in the process of being turned into a ghetto space helmet no longer changes the icon incorrectly.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">cumoverme updated:</h3>

			<h3 class="author">Deity Link updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The color of cult runes now matches the species blood color of whoever wrote it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tweaked the way cult runes look and pulsate a bit.</li>
				<li class="tweak">NPC hostile mobs with ranged weapons will no longer fire if there's a friendly unity between them and their target. Hivebots, aliens, syndicate agents, russians, etc, should stop killing each others now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Ghosts now appear above the blob layer.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob Overminds now get notified when a new overmind appears in a blob core.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob Overminds now have a "damage overlay" that updates as their core takes damage. Similar to the one humans have when they take damage (screen borders become dark/reddish).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Most of the Blob Overmind notifications added in the last update now have a (JUMP) button, so for example you can immediately find which of your blob nodes just got destroyed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob Overminds have a new verb called "Call Overminds", which sends a notification to all the other overminds, along with a button allowing them to jump to you.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob Overminds that spawn in a blob core created by an Overmind are now called Blob Cerebrate. So they can easily tell which one of them was the original one (and the only one who can place new cores)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Intigracy updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Flesh to stone now lasts for 2.5 minutes rather than 8.5 minutes.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Skullyton updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds back-from-the-dead regeneration for simple mobs, and adds it to certain mobs. Said mobs will need to have their bodies destroyed in some way to keep them down.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.05.04</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Sood updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="bugfix">Portable and wall-mounted flashers no longer flash through sunglasses.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.05.02</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Zth updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Slime humans (dna mutantrace) can now heal from electricity. Stun from shocks don't last as much as other races</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.05.01</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Cloroxygen updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Vox traders now spawn with some money and coins.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When vox traders spawn, they have an option to start with a traveler's ID. The ID has no access, and is only used for identification. Lore-wise, a traveler's ID is required to legally travel in human-controlled territories.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.04.29</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Deity Link updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Blobs now emit a cloud of purple smoke over whatever they are affecting. So now you get a clear visual feedback when someone gets attacked by them, or they destroy something (wall or item).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Huge revamp of the blob's visuals. Blobs now support two kind of looks. classic ones (made from 32x32 dmi) and new ones (made from 64x64 dmi)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new looks feature added overlays, animations, such as connections between the blobs, or various feedback animations (normal blob transmitting a pulse, factory producing a mob, resource producing a point, etc)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new looks also features a damage overlay, letting you know approximately how much health the blob part has. In the classic look, only the normal blobs have a damaged sprite.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a new blob gets created (through game mode, random event, or admin spawning), the overmind player gets to choose the blob's looks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Admins can set the looks of every blobs in the world by the push of a new button under the Fun tab.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Resource blobs now look darker if the overmind they were connected to has died. Other overminds can hover near it to take ownership of them and re-activate them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Overminds are now immune to singularities, their pull, and Nar-Sie.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a blob gets pulsed, it will now hurt any mob standing on their tile. Telescience teleporting you right next to the core so you can destroy it without any danger is no longer a viable strategy, unless you have a really good armor, a really powerful gun, and even then it will require some testing.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Blobs cannot destroy docking ports anymore.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The Blob Overmind's HUD now properly indicates how much health his core has.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a lot of messages to Blob Overminds that trigger under a variety of conditions. Such as blobs near their core dying, a special blob that they've placed having been destroyed, or their core getting damaged.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If there are multiple Blob Overminds in the world, they get instantly notified by the death of one of them. They also get notified by the death of any blob core, whether it had an overmind or not.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Shadowmech88 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the mahoguny and the siren as admin-spawnable guns.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds buckshot shells, orderable from Cargo in the shotgun shells crate.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The shotgun shells crate now contains a box of each kind of shell instead of ten loose lethal shells.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The railgun and blunderbuss can now be worn in the belt slot.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Diona now properly take increased burn damage from electrical shocks, and golems now properly take decreased burn damage from electrical shocks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All metal foam reactions will now create metal foam floors if they are on a space tile. Metal foam floors are airtight, but flimsy.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Metal foam reactions made with aluminum will no longer create metal foam walls.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Unid updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Surgically attached limbs no longer magically transform when you attach them to another species' body (this means you can create a human with vox head, tajaran arms and muton legs).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slightly changed how species restricted clothing works in respect to the above change. Now it's possible to, for example, wear vox magboots as a human - but only if both of the human's feet are vox talons.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.04.27</h2>
			<h3 class="author">9600bauds updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Masks that can't be flipped now simply won't have a 'Flip Mask' button, as opposed to having a 'Flip Mask' button that does nothing but takes up space anyways.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.04.26</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Deity Link updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the Adminbus being destroyable by Corrosive Acid.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Simple_Animals xenomorphs (the ones that aren't player controlled) now have a brand new AI! They will spread weeds, break lights near them, and queens will place nests and eggs. They will automatically drag monkeys and incapacitated humans into those nests. Incidentally this means that xenobio will be able to create real xenos if they manage to gold slime an alien queen into existence!</li>
				<li class="tweak">NPC xenos no longer instantly break walls, instead they cover them with hyper acid that destroys them over 5 to 10 seconds. Not a very impactful change, but looks nice.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Mobs stuck onto xeno nests now visually appear partially inside nest.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Xeno weeds now progressively die out over time when the weed nodes are destroyed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xeno eggs now check for nearby potential victims as soon as they become grown, rather than having to wait for a valid human to walk nearby. This way they can jump onto victims that had been stuck onto nests before they were fully grown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can attack burst xeno egg to fully remove them now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All hot weapons now deal full damage to xeno eggs, previously only lit welder did.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Plasma cutters are now hot (which means you can light up your cigarette with one)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Getting stuck onto a xeno nest will stop you from bleeding out (from external wounds), as well as keep you supplied on a bit of inaprovaline, leporazine, and dexaline, sensibly improving your chances of survival (as well as the chances for a successful facehugger rape).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Facehuggers will now target monkeys as well as humans by themselves.</li>
				<li class="tweak">monkeys now appear bellow bedsheets layer items when lying down.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">You can now pick up the skull from a pile of remains.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">New animation for when a human dusts while lying down.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Rejuvinate should now successfuly revive players that had been decapitated.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer extract a brain from a decapitated head coming from a body that had its brain already removed pre-decapitation.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now use soulstone on decapitated bodies or heads, as long as the brain is still inside the head. If using it on the body, the head needs to be 5 tiles or less away from it.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">Using a soulstone now emits a scary wailing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added some new particle effects that move toward a target. Currently appear when using a soulstone, and when using the Drain rune.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Added in-hand sprites for soulstones that have a shade in them.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the imprint mechanic of soulstones. If you summon a shade from a soulstone, you can now use the soulstone on someone else. Soulstones are still consumed when creating constructs though.</li>

I looked it all over once more, tryin' to get to the bottom of this mystery, but it ain't easy finding bugs in some downtrodden code like this.I thought of that paddy dame that showed up in my office last week, asking for me to help her. Said someone called 'Gene Ettics' went AWOL. I told her I'd do what I could, and that's why I'm here. I opened up my flask of brandy and took a sip. It was going to be a long night.

				<li class="rscadd">thermal homeostasis regulator that when emagged becomes the mancrowave</li>
				<li class="tweak">changes to cryo</li>
				<li class="experiment">INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HEAT TRANSFER</li>
				<li class="tweak">removes useless variables heat_protection & cold_protection as these were in 99% of circumstances the exact same as body_parts_covered</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added a new variable, heat_conductivity to all items, determining how fast they conduct heat away from you</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added new procs to humans, sweat() & burn_calories() - Now whenever you use up nutriment, you generate heat, but can also expend nutriment to decrease heat.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">refactored how heat transfer away from humans worked ( see above)</li>
				<li class="experiment">INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HYPOTHERMIA</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added Mild Hypothermia (between 32 and 35C) - this results in shivering, minor slowdown and messages informing the player that they are cold.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added Moderate hypothermia (between 28 and 32C) - Shivering stops, slowdown increases, may slur/stutter words, chance of dropping items in hand and collapsing temporarily, as well as a 25% chance of forgetting how to use machines like when braindamaged</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added severe hypothermia (24 to 28C), shivering stops, player is unconcious, pulse decreases to 30BPM and has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, which decreases over time as you are still breathing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">added profound hypothermia (less than 24C), pulse stops, player has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, does not decrease over time as they are not breathing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">CHANGES THINGS WHICH CAUSE COLD DAMAGE, including but not limited to coldingtons, cryokinesis, showers, goliaths, temperature gun, and chemicals which chill people. Foam fire extinguishers are not affected.</li>
				<li class="experiment">THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR</li>
				<li class="experiment">Please use this when taking someone out of cryo</li>
				<li class="tweak">When a person is dragged in, it will automatically begin stabilising, there is no need for more buttons to be pressed</li>
				<li class="tweak">Takes 5 seconds to heat/cool someone to 37C, which works out as quicker than shaking someone up.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can be emagged to allow for three extra settings - this process is extremely visible, and there is a different sprite for when an emagged function is used</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can reenable security features to quickly unemag the device and Can bring the device to an emergency stop.</li>
				<li class="experiment">CHANGES TO CRYO</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryo now releases someone at 23C instead of -12C (or 25C if they manually eject)</li>
				<li class="experiment">PLEASE USE THE THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR AFTER TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF CRYO</li>
				<li class="tweak">Manual eject time brought down from 2 minutes to 30 seconds to make it time-neutral</li>
				<li class="tweak">This means that, as the person is ejected below profound hypothermia, they will not breathe until they heat up a wee bit further. This is a positive change, as vox & plasmamen will no longer die from toxin damage/fire immediately after leaving cryo.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">People inside a cryo cell do not suffer from hypothermia until leaving.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the ability for ghosts to jump into borers with no ckey assigned. Just click on them as a ghost to check, but you do need to not have the spawnban from ghosting</li>

				<li class="tweak">If a fruit naturally produces than 100 units of a chemical, it will now try to fraction the chemicals into 100 units, rather than discard the overflow.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed not being able to dilute hydroponics tray toxicity by using water.</li>

If you want to remove the trash bag while riding it, use the verb or alt-click.</li>
				<li class="experiment">If you can think of any other alt-click shortcuts that you'd like to see in the game, please don't hesitate to write a letter, stamp it, and mail it to my house, but don't make a feature request or people other than me will have to read it, which gets them mad cranky.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Combat messages (X has attacked Y with Z) will now show up in a bigger font for the player that was hit. For now this only applies to most melee attacks, if you come across a message that you feel should be made bigger for the affected player, don't hesitate to make an in-game report.</li>
