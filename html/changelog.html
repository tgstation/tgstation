				<li class="balance">Ash Walkers now get only one life per player. However, each sacrifice has a 40% chance to give a bonus spawn (limit of one at a time).</li>
				<li class="balance">Dead/incapacitated Ash Walkers that are moved to the nest will be given a new body after a few seconds. This does not require an extra spawn, but also does not count as a sacrifice. Ash Walker bodies without a ghost (should the player have moved on to a new spawner) will be sacrificed as normal.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Borgs being gibbed by the Ash Walker tendril will no longer count as a sacrifice, as they do not actually have blood.</li>
