			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Cult runes can only be scribed on station and on mining.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">New abilities for some races!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Skeletons (liches) and zombies now are much more susceptible to limb loss, but can also reattach lost limbs manually without surgery.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Slimepeople can now lose their limbs, but also can regenerate them if they have the jelly for it. Additionally slimepeople will (involuntarily) lose limbs and convert them to slime jelly if they're extremely low on jelly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Zombies and slimepeople now have reversed toxic damage, what usually heals now hurts and what usually hurts now heals. Keep in mind that while you could for example heal with unstable mutagen, you'd still mutate. Beware of secondary effects! Drugs like antitoxin are especially dangerous to these races now since not only do they do toxin damage, but they remove other toxic chems before they can heal you. Be wary also of wide band healing drugs like omnizine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">For slime people the above mechanic also adds/drains slime jelly. So yes inhaling plasma is now a valid way to build jelly (but you'll still suffocate if there's no oxygen).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pod people now mutate if shot with the mutation setting of the floral somatoray.</li>

				<li class="rscdel">Clock cult scripture unlock now only counts humans and silicons.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Servants of ratvar can now create cogscarab shells with a Script scripture. Adding a soul vessel to one will produce a small, drone-like being with an inbuilt proselytizer and tools.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Clockwork mobs have their own speechbubble icons.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Invoking Sevtug now causes massive hallucinations, brain damage, confusion, and dizziness for all non-servant humans on the same zlevel as the invoker.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Invoking Sevtug is no longer mind control. RIP mind control 2016-2016.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clockwork slabs now produce a component every 50 seconds, from 40, Tinkerer's Caches now produce(if near a clockwork wall) a component every 35 seconds, from 30.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Tinkerer's daemons have a slightly higher cooldown for each component of the type they chose to produce that's already in the cache: This is very slight, but it'll add up if you have a lot of one component type and are trying to get more of it with daemons; 5 of a component type will add a second of delay.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">We've fired the old Pope, who was actually an apprentice in disguise. We've a-pope-riately replaced him with a much more experienced magic user.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Some less-then-sane people have been sighted forming mysterious cults in lieu of recent Pope sightings, lashing out at anyone who speaks ill of him.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">We've rejiggered our trans-dimensional rifts, and almost all cases of clergy members being flung into nothingness should be resolved.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">All members of the Space Wizard's Clergy have been appropriately warned about usage of skin-to-stone spells, and such there should be no more instances of permanent statueification.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">In response to alarmingly high mining cyborg losses, Nanotrasen has equipped the units with an internal positioning beacon, as standard within the module.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Joan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">You can now strike a Tinkerer's Cache with a Clockwork Proselytizer to refill the Proselytizer from the global component cache.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Clockwork Proselytizer requires slightly less alloy to convert windows and windoors.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Several clockwork objects have more useful descriptions, most notably including structures, which will show a general health level to non-servants and exact health to servants.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">The Clockwork Proselytizer has new, more appropriate inhands.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Invoking Inath-Neq, the Resonant Cogwheel, now gives total invulnerability to all servants in range for 15 seconds instead of buffing maximum health.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Impaling a target with a ratvarian spear no longer breaks the spear.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Judicial Markers(the things spawned from Ratvar's Flame, in turn spawned from a Judicial Visor) explode one second faster.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed Dementia Doctrine, replacing it with an Application sigil.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the Sigil of Accession, the previously-mentioned Application sigil, which is much like a Sigil of Submission, except it isn't removed on converting un-mindshielded targets and will disappear after converting a mindshielded target.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sigil of Submission is now a Script instead of a Driver; It's unlocked one tier up, so you have to rely on the Drivers you have until you get Scripts, instead of spamming both Driver sigils for free converts.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To replace Sigil of Submission in the Driver tier; Added Taunting Tirade, which is a chanted scripture with a very fast invocation, which, on chanting, confuses, dizzies, and briefly stuns nearby non-servants and allows the invoker a brief time to relocate before continuing the chant.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ghosts can now see the Gateway to the Celestial Derelict's remaining time as a countdown.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Anima Fragments are now slightly slower if not at maximum health and no longer drop a soul vessel when destroyed.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Joan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">The Gateway to the Celestial Derelict now takes exactly 5 minutes to successfully summon Ratvar and has 500 health, from 1000.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">All Scripture in the Clockwork Slab's recital has a simple description.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Razharas updated:</h3>

			<h3 class="author">kevinz000 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Gravity Guns should no longer destroy local reality when set to attract and shot in an east cardinal direction. Added safety checks has slightly increased the cost of the gun's fabrication. Nanotrasen apologizes for the inconvenience.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Sigils of Transgression will now only stun for about 5 seconds, from around 10 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sigils of Submission take about 5 seconds to convert a target, from around 3 seconds, and will glow faintly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sigils of any type can be attacked with an open hand to destroy them, instead of requiring harm intent. Servants still require harm intent to do so.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Lati updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Nanotrasen has added one of their rare machine prototypes to cargo's selection. It might be valuable to research.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Xhuis updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">You can now create living cake/cat hybrids through a slightly expensive crafting recipe. These "caks" are remarkably resilient, quickly regenerating any brute damage dealt, and can be attacked on harm intent to take a bite to be fed by a small amount. They serve as mobile sources of food and make great pets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If a brain occupied by a player is used in the crafting recipe for caks, that player then takes control of the cak!</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Xhuis updated:</h3>

				<li class="rscadd">Clockwork Slabs, Clockwork Caches near walls, and Tinkerer's Daemons will now be more likely to generate components that the clockwork cult has the least of.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Destroyed Clockwork Caches will drop all Tinkerer's Daemons in them.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clockwork Caches can now only generate a component every 30 seconds(when near a clockwork wall), Clockwork Slabs can only generate a component every 40 seconds, and Tinkerer's Daemons can only generate a component every 20 seconds. This should result in higher component generation for everything except Clockwork Caches near clockwork walls.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Adding a component to a Clockwork Slab instead puts that component in the global component cache.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clockwork Slabs only generate components if held by a mob or in a mob's storage, and when generating a component will prevent other Slabs held from generating a component.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Replicant Driver no longer costs a Replicant Alloy to invoke; basically you can throw free Slabs at converts.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Clockwork Slabs no longer have Repository as a menu option; instead, you can examine them to see how many components they have access to.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Joan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="wip">This is a bunch of Clockwork Cult changes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Clockwork Obelisk, an Application scripture that produces a clockwork obelisk, which can Hierophant Broadcast a large message to all servants or open a Spatial Gateway with 5 uses and a 10 second duration to any conscious servant or clockwork obelisk.</li>
				<li class="wip">Spatial Gateways of any source have doubled uses and duration when the target is a clockwork obelisk.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Mania Motor, an Application scripture that produces a mania motor, which, while active, causes hallucinations and brain damage in all nearby humans.</li>
				<li class="wip">The Mania Motor will try to convert any non-servant human directly adjacent to it at an additional power cost and will remove brain damage, hallucinations, and the druggy effect from servants.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Vitality Matrix, an Application scripture that produces a sigil that will slowly drain health from non-servants that remain on it. Servants that remain on the sigil will instead be healed with the vitality drained from non-servants.</li>
				<li class="wip">The Vitality Matrix can revive dead servants for a cost of 25 vitality plus all non-oxygen damage the servant has. If it cannot immediately revive a servant, it will still heal their corpse.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Most clockwork structures, including the Mending Motor, Interdiction Lens, and the newly added Clockwork Obelisk and Mania Motor, now require power to function.</li>
				<li class="wip">Mending Motors can still use alloy for power.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Sigil of Transmission has been remade into a power battery and will power directly adjecent clockwork structures. Sigils of Transmission start off with 4000 power and can be recharged with Volt Void.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Volt Void drains somewhat more power, but will not damage the invoker unless they drain too much power. Invokers with augmented limbs will instead have those limbs healed unless they drain especially massive amounts of power.</li>
				<li class="wip">Using Volt Void on top of a Sigil of Transmission will transfer most of the power drained to the Sigil of Transmission, effectively making it far less likely to damage the invoker.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">You can no longer stack most sigils and clockwork objects with themself. You can still have multiple different objects or sigils on a tile, however.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Break Will Script has been renamed to Dementia Doctrine, is slightly faster, and causes slightly more brain damage.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Judicial Visor now uses an action button instead of alt-click. Cultists of Nar-Sie judged by the visor will be stunned for half duration, but will be set on fire.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Multiple scriptures have had their component requirements changed. The Summon Judicial Visor Script has been reduced from a Script to a Driver.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Recollection will now show both required and consumed components.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clockwork Marauders can now emerge from their host if their host is at or below 60% total health(for humans, this is 20 health out of crit)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clockwork Marauders will slowly heal if directly adjacent to their host and have a slightly larger threshold for their no-Fatigue bonus damage.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Quiltyquilty updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Botany, atmospherics and cargo now all have access to high-capacity watertanks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The bar has now been outfitted with custom bar stools.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Xhuis updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Removed the global message played when Nar-Sie _begins_ to spawn (but not when it actually spawns).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Drunkenness recovery speed now increases with how drunk the imbiber is and is much quicker when the imbiber is asleep.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Suit storage units now take three seconds to enter (up from one) and have different sounds and messages for UV ray cauterization.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some bugs with the suit storage unit, inserting mobs, and contents to seemed to duplicate themselves.</li>
