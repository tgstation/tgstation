			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">The Teleport Other, Veil, Imbue, Reveal, Disguise, Blood Drain, Timestop, Stun, Deafen, Blind, Armaments, Construct Shell and Summon Tome runes are gone.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Disguise, Veil/Reveal, Construct Shell and Armaments are now talismans. The Construction talisman requires 25 sheets of metal.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists will now receive a warning when attempting to use emergency communion or create the Nar-Sie rune</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists can now create talismans with a super-simple Talisman-Creation rune. It takes about 10 seconds to invoke and will present a menu of all the talisman choices available. Its as simple as tossing the paper on, clicking the rune, and selecting your talisman.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cultists now have a proc, "How to Play" that will give a basic explanation of how to succeed as a cultist.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new Talisman of Horror is a stealthy talisman that will cause hallucinations in the victim. Great for undermining security without having to commit to murder them in middle of the hall.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Creating the Summon Nar-Sie rune does takes slightly less time, but now adds a 3x3 square of red barrier shields (60hp each) to prevent the rune-scriber from being bumped by other idiots. This works in conjunction with the rune's warning to give crew a chance to stop the summoning. Manifest ghost has a weaker 1x1 shield to prevent bumps as well.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Talismans are now color-coded by their effect so you can easily organize and deploy talismans.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now make colored paper in the washing machine using crayons or stamps, honk.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Electromagnetic Disruption rune will now scale with the number of cultists invoking the rune. **A full 9-cultist invocation will EMP the entire station!**</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Armaments will now give the recipient a new cult bola.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new Talisman of Shackling will apply handcuffs directly to the victim. These cuffs will disappear when removed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cult slur is a little less potent so victims might be able to squeeze in a coherent word or two if you let them keep jabbering on the radio, stun talismans now have less of a health cost and the stun is back to 10 seconds, from 9.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rune and Talisman names now give a much clearer idea of what they do.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The following changes are courtesy of ChangelingRain</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Teleport rune now allows cultists to select which rune to teleport to, and teleports everything on it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Veil and Reveal are merged into Talisman of Veiling. Veiling has two uses, the first use will hide and the second use will reveal.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New icons for the cult bola</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now attack fellow cultists with a Talisman of Arming to arm them with robes and a sword.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now only place one rune per tile.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Ghosts are notified when a new manifest rune is created.</li>
