				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the message you get when examining a brain, which was supposed to differentiate brains with a player still inside and brains belonging to a ghosted player.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Diona nymphs not regenerating health from bright lights. Note that their health regen is much much slower than grown Diona. Did not 'fix' the way they take damage from darkness, meaning they still pretty much just don't.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Reworked conveyor belt construction to be faster and simpler: Conveyor belts are now built with their own machine frame which doesn't require wiring and can be walked over. This new conveyor belt frame will also copy the direction you're facing when building it. To make a conveyor belt assembly: Build it from 5 metal sheets, just like a machine frame.</li>
				<li class="imgadd">Conveyor belt assembly sprites courtesy of Blithering.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Newly built conveyor belts will now automatically try to copy the frequency and ID tag of any other conveyor belts immediately next to them. This lets you easily create long conveyor belt lines without having to configure every single one of them, so long as you configured the first one before building the others.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Multitool buffer cloning now works on conveyor belts: Add a conveyor belt/conveyor switch to a Multitool's buffer, click the Multitool in your hand to enable cloning mode, then click on a conveyor belt. It will instantly copy the frequency and ID tag from buffer, and if the buffer was taken from a conveyor belt, it will also copy it's direction.</li>
