		<li class="rscdel">Reverted dismemberment, the recent gun changes, and Tarajans. Before you shit up the forums, read this:</li>
		<li>Dismemberment was ported from Bay12, but only halfway, and there were several problems with it. I know many people really liked it, but as it stood it did not fit the playstyle here at all. This <b>had</b> to be removed, there is work on a more fitting system, but this had to be taken out first regardless, and the longer people beat around the bush the worse the situation got.</li>
		<li>The gun change was made for no real reason and was pretty problematic, so reverting that should mean there are a lot less 'accidental suicides.'</li>
		<li>Tarjans were reverted by request as well, and since keeping them working after removing dismemberment would be a stupid amount of work.</li>

		<li class="wip">CONTRABAND-CON UPDATE: Added posters. I'm sorry to add it seperately with the rest of contraband, but there was a lack of sprites for everything else. Hopefully, people will gain interest and get me some damn sprites this way :3

                <BR><BR>How they get on-board: The quartermaster can now set the receiver frequency of his supplycomp circuit board. A bit simplistic as of now, will work on it later. Building a supplycomp with a properly set up circuitboard will give access to the Contraband crate.
                <BR><BR>How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.
