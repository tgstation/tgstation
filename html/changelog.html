				<li class="tweak">Throwing was refactored to cause less lag and be more precise</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Item throwing now imparts the momentum of the user throwing. Throwing in the direction you are moving throws the item faster, throwing away from the direction you are moving throws the item slower. This should make hitting yourself with floor tiles less likely.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Colossi now drop the Voice of God, a mouth organ that, if implanted, allows you to speak in a HEAVY TONE. This voice can compel hearers to briefly obey certain codewords, such as "STOP". Using these codewords will severely increase this ability's cooldown, and only one will be used per sentence.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Use .x, :x, or #x as a prefix to use Voice of God or any future vocal cord organs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Chaplains, being closer to the gods, and command staff, being used to giving orders, gain an increased effect when using the Voice of God. The mime, not being used to speaking, has a reduced effect.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Joan updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Clockwork Marauders no longer have Fatigue. It was difficult to balance and made them too easy to force into recalling. This means they just have health; they aren't forced to recall by anything, but can accordingly die much more easily.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Accordingly Clockwork Marauders now have more health, do slightly more damage, block slightly more often, and have to go slightly further from their host to take damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Marauders that are not recovering(from recalling while the host's health is too high to emerge) and are inside their host, or are within a tile of their host, will gradually heal their host until their host is above the health threshold to emerge.</li>
