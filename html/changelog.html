			<h3 class="author">DrCelt / Intigracy updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">(DrCelt) Fixed a bug where species damage modifiers were applied twice.</li>
				<li class="tweak">(DrCelt) As a result of this, brute/burn modifiers are slightly less effective when it comes to resistance/weakness (less damage resisted, less damage taken, respectively)</li>
				<li class="tweak">(Intigracy) Dionae burn damage is an exception, it has changed from 6.25 to 6.2</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="author">9600bauds updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">The following changes required a lot of rewriting and refactoring of old-ass code. I've tested this as best as I could, but if you notice any bugs still, please don't hesitate to make a bug report!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Trying to put an item in the wrong slot via the stripping menu now gives an explicit error message, so as to not waste your time.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Buffed the Pickpocket's Gloves: Their effects now apply to all storage slots, not just ID and pockets.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now toggle someone's suit sensors via the stripping menu, without having to remove their jumpsuit.</li>
				<li class="tweak">There is now one unified option to toggle other people's internals via the stripping menu, which is available even if they have a tank in their pockets or hands.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Simplified the way toggling internals chooses a tank: It will now simply look in your suit storage, then back, then belt, then pockets, then hands. It will also only take internals from a jetpack as last option.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed items in your pocket slots not applying their on_found() effects (e.g. mousetraps) when stripped individually, only when your jumpsuit was stripped.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed items in your pocket slots not applying their on_stripped() effects (e.g. SPS) when your jumpsuit was stripped, only individually.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removes the ability to perform CPR on alien larvas. Sorry guys.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Accidentally fixed bug where you could spam CPR and do CPR multiple times at the same time in the same mob. Sorry guys.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed borers (or any other simple animals you can't control normally) never decreasing their deaf/confused/blind timers, thus being forever deaf/confused/blind.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Borers will no longer be blinded by flashbangs if their host has flash protection (since they're seeing out of their host's eyes and whatnot).</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">2016.06.17</h2>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Massively expanded the Vox Outpost for the benefit of the traders there</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the Courtroom significantly. You'll need to use the TV Monitors to watch the proceedings properly (won't be able to see judge from seats) but they broadcast speech and the seats, so it's functionally identical</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Shadowmech88 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Borers can now inhabit a human's left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, and chest in addition to their head. A human may have one borer in each of these limbs. The borer's available evolutions are influenced by the limb it is currently inhabiting.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Exxion updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Bandoliers are now accessories rather than exosuits. This means they attach directly to your jumpsuit rather than taking up your exosuit slot. They can be removed with the Remove Accessory verb. You should be able to figure out how to use them. Note that, like other storage accessories, they must be removed in order to take the jumpsuit off by yourself.</li>

If the limb is so damaged that it would immediately break again after setting the bone, it will now heal to just under bone fracture levels. Note that this effectively lets you heal brute damage on dead people.</li>
