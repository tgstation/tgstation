			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="imageadd">The default white ghost form now has directional sprites.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The default white ghost form now also has (your) hair! Here's how it works.</li>
				<li class="experiment">If you ghost from a body, you'll get the hair from that body. If it has hair.</li>
				<li class="experiment">If you hit Observe, you'll get the hair from the character you had active in your setup window. If they had hair.</li>
				<li class="wip">This only works with the default white ghost form right now (because the other forms have the wrong shape or lack directional sprites), and with human bodies since they're the only ones that have hair. Sorry lizards and plasmamen! You'll get your turn next time.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A new preference called Ghost Accessories. This lets you configure if you want your ghost sprite to show both hair and directional sprites, only directional sprites or just use its original default version without directional sprites.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A new preference called Ghosts of Others. This preference is clientside and lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you: as their own setting, as the form they chose but without any hair or directional sprites, or as the simple white ghost sprite if you're sick of those premium users with their rainbow ghosts.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The layout of the ghost preference buttons has slightly changed. The old Choose Ghost Form and Choose Ghost Orbit are now a part of Ghost Customization, which also contains the new Ghost Accessories button. Clicking Ghost Customization will send you directly to Ghost Accessories if you don't have premium. The Preferences tab now also contains the Ghost Display button, which lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where the toggles for Ghost Accessories and Ghosts of Others in the Preferences menu wouldn't save your preference update to your save file.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Renamed the "Ghost Display Settings" preference toggle button to "Ghosts of Others", so it fits with the name the preference has everywhere else.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The spells disintegrate and flesh to stone have had their mechanics changed. Using these spells will spawn a special touch weapon in a free hand (your dominant hand if possible) that can then be used to inflict the spell on the target of your choice. Having the touch weapon out is obvious, this is not a stealth based change. Clicking the spell while the hand is out will let you return the charge without using it.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The spell won't begin to recharge until the hand attack is either used or returned. Additionally these changes mean you can no longer use these spells while stunned or handcuffed. As a suggestion remember that the mutate spell allows you to break out of cuffs very easily, and warping abilities will keep you from getting cuffed to begin with!</li>
