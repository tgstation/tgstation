		<li class='rscadd'><b>Nanotrasen Anomaly Primer:</b><br>
		Unstable anomalies have been spotted in your region of space. These anomalies can be hazardous and destructive, though our initial encounters with these space oddities has discovered a method of neutralization. Method follows.<br>
		<p>Step 1. Upon confirmation of an anomaly sighting, report its location. Early detection is key.<br>
		Step 2. Using an atmospheric analyzer at short range, determine the frequency that the anomaly's core is fluctuating at.</br>
		Step 3. Send a signal through the frequency using a radio signaller. Note that non-specialized signaller devices may possibly lack the frequency range needed.<br></p>
		With the anomaly neutralized and the station brought out of danger, inspect the area for any remnants of the anomaly. Properly researched, we believe these events could provide vast amounts of valuable data.<br>

		<li class='rscadd'>We at Nanotrasen would like to assure you that we know the pain of waiting five minutes for the emergency shuttle to be dispatched in a high-alert situation due to our confirmation-of-distress policy. Therefore, we have amended our confirmation-of-distress policy so that, in the event of a red alert, the distress confirmation period is shortened to three minutes and we will hurry in preparing the shuttle for transit. This totals to 6 minutes, in hope that it will give our <b>very expensive equipment</b> a better chance of recovery.</li>
