			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">The Interdiction Lens has been reworked; instead of allowing you to disable Telecomms, Cameras, or non-Servant Cyborgs, it drains power from all APCs, SMES units, and non-Servant cyborgs in a relatively large area, funneling that power into nearby Sigils of Transmission, then disables all cameras and radios in that same area.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Shuttles now only run over mobs in turfs they are moving into, rather than the entire rectangle.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you are an observer, you can click on transition edges of a Z-level in order to move as a mob would.</li>

			<h3 class="author">coiax, incoming updated:</h3>

				<li class="rscdel">Those who do not serve Ratvar cannot understand His creations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now repair clockwork structures with a clockwork proselytizer. This is about a third as efficient as a mending motor, costing 2 liquified alloy to 1 health, and also about a third as fast.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Scarab proselytizers are more efficient and will reap more alloy from metal and plasteel.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">They can also directly convert rods to alloy.</li>

				<li class="experiment">New abilities for some races!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Skeletons (liches) and zombies now are much more susceptible to limb loss, but can also reattach lost limbs manually without surgery.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Slimepeople can now lose their limbs, but also can regenerate them if they have the jelly for it. Additionally slimepeople will (involuntarily) lose limbs and convert them to slime jelly if they're extremely low on jelly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Zombies and slimepeople now have reversed toxic damage, what usually heals now hurts and what usually hurts now heals. Keep in mind that while you could for example heal with unstable mutagen, you'd still mutate. Beware of secondary effects! Drugs like antitoxin are especially dangerous to these races now since not only do they do toxin damage, but they remove other toxic chems before they can heal you. Be wary also of wide band healing drugs like omnizine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">For slime people the above mechanic also adds/drains slime jelly. So yes inhaling plasma is now a valid way to build jelly (but you'll still suffocate if there's no oxygen).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pod people now mutate if shot with the mutation setting of the floral somatoray.</li>

				<li class="wip">This is a bunch of Clockwork Cult changes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Clockwork Obelisk, an Application scripture that produces a clockwork obelisk, which can Hierophant Broadcast a large message to all servants or open a Spatial Gateway with 5 uses and a 10 second duration to any conscious servant or clockwork obelisk.</li>
				<li class="wip">Spatial Gateways of any source have doubled uses and duration when the target is a clockwork obelisk.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Mania Motor, an Application scripture that produces a mania motor, which, while active, causes hallucinations and brain damage in all nearby humans.</li>
				<li class="wip">The Mania Motor will try to convert any non-servant human directly adjacent to it at an additional power cost and will remove brain damage, hallucinations, and the druggy effect from servants.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Vitality Matrix, an Application scripture that produces a sigil that will slowly drain health from non-servants that remain on it. Servants that remain on the sigil will instead be healed with the vitality drained from non-servants.</li>
				<li class="wip">The Vitality Matrix can revive dead servants for a cost of 25 vitality plus all non-oxygen damage the servant has. If it cannot immediately revive a servant, it will still heal their corpse.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Most clockwork structures, including the Mending Motor, Interdiction Lens, and the newly added Clockwork Obelisk and Mania Motor, now require power to function.</li>
				<li class="wip">Mending Motors can still use alloy for power.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Sigil of Transmission has been remade into a power battery and will power directly adjecent clockwork structures. Sigils of Transmission start off with 4000 power and can be recharged with Volt Void.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Volt Void drains somewhat more power, but will not damage the invoker unless they drain too much power. Invokers with augmented limbs will instead have those limbs healed unless they drain especially massive amounts of power.</li>
				<li class="wip">Using Volt Void on top of a Sigil of Transmission will transfer most of the power drained to the Sigil of Transmission, effectively making it far less likely to damage the invoker.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">You can no longer stack most sigils and clockwork objects with themself. You can still have multiple different objects or sigils on a tile, however.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Break Will Script has been renamed to Dementia Doctrine, is slightly faster, and causes slightly more brain damage.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Judicial Visor now uses an action button instead of alt-click. Cultists of Nar-Sie judged by the visor will be stunned for half duration, but will be set on fire.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Multiple scriptures have had their component requirements changed. The Summon Judicial Visor Script has been reduced from a Script to a Driver.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">When a mob leaves a blood trail while dragged, it loses blood. You can no longer drag a corpse to make an inifinite amount of blood trails, because once the victim's blood reaches a certain threshold it no longer leaves a blood trail (and no longer lose any more blood). The threshold depends on how much damage the mob has taken. You can always avoid hurting the dragged mob by making them stand up or by buckling them to something or by putting them in a container.</li>
