			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Robustin updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Blood magic. The next generation of talismans - you can create 2 spells without a rune, up to 5 with a rune of empowerment. Preparing spells without a rune will cost a significant amount of blood. Every talisman has been rebalanced for its spell form. With a few exceptions, blood magic exists as a "touch" spell that is very similar in behavior/appearance to the wizard touch spells.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New UI system for cultists.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed talismans, Talisman Creation Rune replaced by Rune of Empowerment. Supply talisman has been replaced by a ritual dagger and 10 runed metal.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ritual Dagger, replacing the Arcane Tome. This is largely a thematic alteration but its to reinforce that your primary tool is also a weapon.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Cyborgs and AI are finally unable to see runes again</li>
				<li class="tweak">Only the cult master can forge Bastard swords now, regular cultists can get a mirror shield.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The mirror shield, it blocks, it reflects, it creates illusions, and an incredible throwing weapon! The mirror shield also bears a unique weakness: Shotgun slugs, .357 rounds, and other high damage projectiles will instantly shatter it and briefly stun the holder.</li>
				<li class="balance">Nar'sien Bolas will not longer ensnare cultists and non-cultists will ensnare themselves when attempting to use them. The bolas are now comparable in effectiveness with reinforced bolas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Rune of Spirits. This merges the Spirit Sight and Manifest Ghost rune. The user will now choose which effect when invoking.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Spirit Sight function has received several major improvements, allowing the ghost to commune with the cult and mark objects similar how the cult master can. The user has a unique appearance while ghosted and manifested cult ghosts can see ghosts as well - allowing their summoner to lead them from the spirit realm.</li>
				<li class="balance">The Form Barrier rune will now last significantly longer and examining the rune as a cultist will tell you how long it will remain.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Apocalypse Rune. Replaces the EMP runes. Has a fixed invoker requirement and added usage limitations.  It scales depending on the crew's strength relative to the cult. Effect includes a massive EMP, unique hallucination for non-cultists, and if the cult is doing poorly, certain events. The rune can only occur in the Nar-Sie ritual sites and will prevent Nar-Sie from being summoned there in the future.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">No more EMP rune.</li>
				<li class="balance">The conceal/reveal spell now has 10 charges and will conceal far more, including cult structures and flooring.</li>
				<li class="balance">The stun spell will now stun for ~4 less seconds and silence for 2 more seconds.</li>
				<li class="balance">The EMP spell now costs 10 health to use, up from 5, and has had its heavy/light EMP range nerfed by 1 and 2 respectively (now 3 and 6).</li>
				<li class="balance">The shackles spell now has a silence effect similar to the stun talisman.</li>
				<li class="balance">The hallucination spell now has multiple charges.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The teleport spell can now be used on other adjacent cultists.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Summon Tome and Summon Armor have been combined into "Summon Equipment", which lets you choose between summoning a Ritual Dagger or Combat Gear (same loadout that Summon Armor used to provide).</li>
				<li class="balance">Standard cult robes now have -10 melee and -10 laser armor.</li>
				<li class="balance">The "Construction" spell will now convert airlocks into cult airlocks and cyborgs (after ~10 seconds) into constructs. The airlock is the most fragile in the game, with reduced integrity, armor, and render it vulnerable to most attacks. Cyborg "reconstruction" will be accompanied by an obvious effect/sound.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood Rites. This spell allows you to absorb blood from your surroundings or adjacent non-cultists. You can use the blood rites as a convenient heal (self-healing is significantly more costly though) or you can try to gather large quantities of blood for unique and powerful relics.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood spear, a fragile but robust spear with a special recall ability</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood bolts, the cultist's version of arcane barrage. The bolts will infuse cultists with unholy water and damage anything else.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood beam, the ultimate blood rite. After a channeling period it will fire 12 powerful beams across a long distance, piercing almost any surface (except blessed turf), and damaging all non-cult life caught in the beam.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All cult structures now generate significantly less light.</li>
				<li class="balance">Pylons will now heal constructs faster and restore slightly more blood than before.</li>
				<li class="balance">Cult floors are now highly resistant to atmospheric changes.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Unholy water will now splash victims properly.</li>
				<li class="balance">Unholy Water Vials created at altars now contains 50 units, and is better at healing brute, and deals slightly more damage to non-cultists, the splash ratio was reduced to 20% to compensate for the increased volume and damage.</li>
				<li class="balance">Holy water will purge any and all blood spells from cultists.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Artificers, Wraiths and Juggernauts can now scribe revive, teleport, and barrier runes respectively with a 3 minute cooldown.</li>
				<li class="balance">Juggernauts' forcewall is now 3x1 but it has a ~30% longer cooldown. Juggernauts got a modest speed increase (2.5 from 3) but lost a modest amount of HP (200 from 250).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Juggernauts now get a ranged attack "Gauntlet Echo", a single projectile that moves about as fast as them and does 30 damage with 5 seconds of stun and a 35s cooldown.</li>
				<li class="balance">The number of ghosts summonable by the manifest spirit rune is 3, down from 5.</li>
				<li class="balance">It now takes ~20% less water (~25 units) and ~30 seconds less to deconvert cultists via holy water.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The emagged library console will now distribute ritual daggers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Using the dagger on a rune will now take a 1-second channel to destroy it, to avoid incidents where people instantly wipe a critical rune by accident.</li>
				<li class="balance">Standard runed airlocks now have a lower damage deflection so they can be destroyed with most respectable melee weapons (10+).</li>
				<li class="balance">Teleporter runes that are used from space or lavaland will result in the destination rune giving off a unique effect for 60 seconds. This effect includes a long distance (but not obvious antagonistic) sound, a bright lighting effect, and a visual cue that will indicate where the cultist arrived from.</li>

They can be attached to walls, and hold defibrillators for public use. You can swipe an ID to clamp the defibrillator in place, and it will automatically draw from the powernet to recharge it. Being one tile away from the mount will force you to drop the paddles.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Eminence role to clockcult! Players can elect themselves or ghosts as the Eminence from the eminence spire structure on Reebe.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Eminence is incorporeal and invisible, and directs the entire cult. Anything they say is heard over the Hierophant network, and they can issue commands by middle-clicking themselves or different turfs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Eminence also has a single-use mass recall that warps all servants to the Ark chamber.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added traps, triggers, and brass filaments to link them. They can all be constructed from brass sheets, and do different things and trigger in different ways. Current traps include the brass skewer and steam vent, and triggers include the pressure sensor, lever, and repeater.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Eminence can activate trap triggers by clicking on them!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Servants can deconstruct traps instantly with a wrench.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Mending Mantra has been removed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clockwork scriptures have been recolored and sorted based on their functions; yellow scriptures are for construction, red for offense, blue for defense, and purple for niche.</li>
				<li class="balance">Servants now spawn with a PDA and black shoes to make disguise more feasible.</li>
				<li class="balance">The Eminence can superheat up to 20 clockwork walls at a time. Superheated walls are immune to hulk and mech punches, but can still be broken conventionally.</li>
				<li class="balance">Clockwork walls are slightly faster to build before the Ark activates, taking an extra second less.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Poly no longer continually undergoes binary fission when Ratvar is in range.</li>
				<li class="code_imp">The global records alert for servants will no longer display info that doesn't affect them since the rework.</li>

				<li class="config">The default view range can now be defined in the config. The default is 15x15, which is simplified to 7 by BYOND. For reference, Goonstation's widescreen range is 21x15. Do note that changing this value will affect the title screen. The title screen images and the title screen area on the Centcom z-level will have to be updated if the default view range is changed.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Brain damage has been completely reworked! remove: Brain damage now no longer simply makes you dumb. Although most of its effects have been shifted into a brain trauma.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Every time you take brain damage, there's a chance you'll suffer a brain trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and special.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Severe brain traumas are much rarer and require extensive brain damage before you have a chance to get them; they are usually very debilitating. Unlike mild traumas, they require surgery to cure. A new surgery procedure has been added for this, the aptly named Brain Surgery. It can also heal minor traumas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Special brain traumas are rarely gained in place of Severe traumas: they are either complex or beneficial. However, they are also even easier to cure than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping a mild trauma along with it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mobs can only naturally have one mild trauma and one severe or special trauma.</li>
				<li class="balance">Brain damage will now kill and ruin the brain if it goes above 200. If it somehow goes above 400, the brain will melt and be destroyed completely.</li>
				<li class="balance">Many brain-damaging effects have been given a damage cap, making them non-lethal.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The Unintelligible mutation has been removed and made into a brain trauma.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Brain damage no longer makes using machines a living hell.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Abductors give minor traumas to people they experiment on.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="refactor">Completely changed how keyboard input is read.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Holding two directions at the same time will now move you diagonally. This works with the arrow keys, wasd, and the numpad.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Moving diagonally takes twice as long as moving a cardinal direction.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can use control to turn using wasd and the numpad instead of just the arrow keys.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Some old non-hotkey mode behaviors, especially in relation to chatbox interaction, can't be kept with the new system. Of key note: You can't type while walking. This is due to limitations of byond and the work necessary to overcome it is better done as another overhaul allowing custom controls.</li>
