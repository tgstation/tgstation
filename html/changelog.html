		<li class="wip">CONTRABAND-CON UPDATE: Added posters.</li>
                <li class="rscadd">POSTERS! Posters come in rolled packages that can adhere to any wall or r_wall, if it's uncluttered enough.
                <BR><BR>?How they get on-board: The quartermaster can now set the receiver frequency of his supplycomp circuit board. A bit simplistic as of now, will work on it later. Building a supplycomp with a properly set up circuitboard will give access to the Contraband crate.
                <BR><BR>?How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>?How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>?How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.
		<li class="tweak">Merged 'Game' and 'Lobby' tabs during pre-game into one tab</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Added the little red x to the late-join job list</li>

		<li class="tweak">Droppers are now used at the eyes, and thus, access to the eyes is required to have an effect.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Mining shuttle computer no longer spits out both 'Shuttle has been sent' and 'The shuttle is already moving' every time.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Adds a borg upgrade that increases their speed.  Requires gold.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Fixes autolathes not doing anything.</li>
		<li class="tweak">Changed Chief Engineers Office door name. Stop breaking in!</li>
		<li class="tweak">Added new airlocks to mining dock, research, and atmospherics.</li>
		<li class="tweak">RCDs are disabled if they are used on the escape shuttle or hyperspace around it.</li>
		<li class="tweak">EMPs will now cause flashes to flash their holder.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Heads now get a silver ID!</li>
		<li class="tweak">Blenders can now be filled directly from plant bags. Chefs rejoice.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">The biogenerator is now more robust. It can dispense fertilizer in batches, and make simple leather items at a high cost. Added more wood items for tower cap wood construction: Wooden doors and sandals. Added plump helmet biscuits and mushroom soup to kitchen recipes.</li>
		<li class="tweak">Watermelon and pumpkin biomass lowered a bit so biomass isn't totally trivial to acquire. </li>
