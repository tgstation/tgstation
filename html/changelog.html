	<ul class="changes bgimages16">
		<li class="rscadd">Made a 'default' save slot (D), and whenever you connect it automatically selects the default slot to load from, but manually selecting a different slot will allow you to play on that one before it returns to default.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Added the ability to name your save slots with the '*'. Names can be up to 16 characters and contain letters, numbers, and basic symbols</li>
		<li class="rscadd">The preview icon on the preference screen now takes into account any job you have set on high, and dresses up the icon accordingly. If assistant is set to 'yes', or AI/Cyborg are on high it will put the icon in a grey suit (So you can still customize). </li>
		<li class="rscadd">Nuke Ops get a new pinpointer, changing modes with the verb will switch between pointing to the disk, and pointing to the shuttle. Also provides a notification when you leave the station z-level</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Reworked how MMI Life() was done, now they will never lose consciousness, and many less things affect them now(Like deafening/blindness from explosions). However, they are vulnerable to EMPs, but all damage is temporary.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Clowns will no longer be killed trying to use holo eswords</li>

		<li class="tweak">Both the chef and bartender have access to the bar area so both can serve if the other is incompetent or does not exist. Bartender's shotgun and shaker were moved to his back room and the booze-o-mat is now ID restricted to the bartender.</li>

The APC needs to be charged for a long enough time before it starts turning equipment on, to avoid spazzing out. If you have any problems with it, such as equipment turning off and on repeatedly then please make an issue report with a screenshot of the APC.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Added the Light Replacer. This is a device that can auto replace lights that are broken, missing or burnt. Currently it is found in the Janitor's closet and Janitor Borgs can equip it. You can refill it with glass, or if you're a Cyborg, just recharge. It is emaggable and will replace lights with rigged lights. The light's explosion was nerfed to help balance it and it is very noticable when you are holding an emagged Light Replacer.</li>
		<li class="tweak">The Janitor's equipment locator, on their PDA, will now tell you the direction of the equipment.</li>

	<ul class="changes bgimages16">
		<li class="rscadd">pAI gets a better PDA that can actually receive messages from people. They can also instantly reply like everybody else now and they can toggle their receiver/signaller/ringer.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">You can show the AI the notes on your PDA by holding it up to a camera. When you show up a paper/pda to the camera the AI can now click on your name to go to you, if you're near a camera. People who are Unknown will not have a link; which would've allowed the AI to track them.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Made the" common server" and the "preset right receiver" listen for frequencies 144.1 to 148.9. This will allow people to use different frequencies to talk to eachother without bothering the common channel. It will also allow Revs and Cultists to work with each other; everything is still logged though so it still has risks.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Increased the maximum frequency limit for handheld radios and intercoms. It will give you the option to just use station bounced radios on a higher frequency so that anyone with a headset can't simply tune in.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Created an All-In-One Grinder that is suppose to replace the blender, juicer and reagent grinder all together. Meaning any department that has a juicer, blender and grinder will instead get this. It will help people be more independent from Chemistry by recycling foods and plants.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Added a couple of Emergency Shield Projectors to Engineering secure storage.
		<p>Note: Credit goes to Barhardar for the original code and functionality.
		<p>These devices can be used to quickly create an air-tight seal across a hull breach until repairs can been made.
		<p>Wrench them in place and activate them near a hull breach. The shield should extend to all space tiles in range.
		<p>They can be (un)locked by engineering IDs and can also be emagged and otherwise malfunction. As they can not be constructed, you can repair damage and malfunctions by opening the panel with a screwdriver and replacing the wires with a cable coil</li>

		<li class="wip">I'm currently working on cleaning up and moving around a large portion of the mob code. These changes do not directly affect players; HOWEVER, bugs, oversights or simple mistakes may cause problems for players. While I have tested as much as I can, there may be some lingering bugs I have missed. <p> This part of the mob code cleanup mainly focuses on damage variables and procs. So if you suspect something related to taking, dealing or examining damage is not working as intended please fill out an issue report <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/issues/list">here</a> and be as detailed as possible. This includes what you were doing, steps to reproduce the problem, who you were doing it to, what you were using ect... Thank you.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Alien hunters will now cloak when using the 'stalk' movement intent. Whilst cloaked they will use up their plasma reserves. They can however cloak as long as they like. Using the Lay-down verb will allow them to remain cloaked without depleting their plasma reserves,  hence allowing them to lay ambushes for unsuspecting prey. Should a hunter attack anybody, or get knocked down in any way,  they will become visible. Hopefully this allows for more strategic/stealthy gameplay from aliens. On the other hand, I may have totally  screwed the balance so feedback/other-ideas are welcome.</li>

		<li class="wip"><font color="purple"><b>Massive Mob-Icon Overhaul:</b><br>A large amount of the mob code has been replaced. The systems replaced were causing immense performance issues so the following are very necessary optimisations.<br>However, there is a downside: SS13 code is the equivilant of monkeys on typewriters. Despite weeks of constant coding/testing there -will- be things I've missed. The kinds of bugs I'm expecting are overlays not updating and/or in rare cases things not appearing in your hud. Most of these issues can be worked around simply by dropping the item and picking it back up. If all else fails ask an admin to regenerate your icons through view-vars.<br><u>Please</u> report any bugs to me on <b>#coderbus IRC</b> or <b>make an issue on the tracker</b> as a matter of urgency. I will fix them ASAP.<br>Also a massive thankyou to Nodrak, Erro, Pete and Willox. :)</font></li>
		<li class="tweak">Massive rewrite of the overlays system (particularly for humans). Stuff is cached and only updates when necessary. In effect this means faster updates, less overheads/lag, and less reliance on the game-ticker.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Numerous bugfixes and tweaks for damage-procs and damage-overlays for humans. They should now be almost seamless, use very little overhead and update instantly.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">TK grab can now be cancelled using the throw hotkey. (so now it toggles on/off like it used to).</li>

This <b>had</b> to be removed, there is work on a more fitting system, but this had to be taken out first regardless, and the longer people beat around the bush the worse the situation got.</li>

		<li class="wip">CONTRABAND-CON UPDATE: Added posters. I'm sorry to add it seperately with the rest of contraband, but there was a lack of sprites for everything else. Hopefully, people will gain interest and get me some damn sprites this way :3
		As I said, this is an ongoing project of mine. So starting of, we've got...</li>
                <li class="rscadd">POSTERS! Posters come in rolled packages that can adhere to any wall or r_wall, if it's uncluttered enough.
                <BR><BR>How they get on-board: The quartermaster can now set the receiver frequency of his supplycomp circuit board. A bit simplistic as of now, will work on it later. Building a supplycomp with a properly set up circuitboard will give access to the Contraband crate.
                <BR><BR>How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.
