			<h3 class="author">Deity Link updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Revamped bike horns. Their honk sound is now their hitsound, so hitting someone with a bike horn will make it honk. That also means that admins can replace that sound with anything.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">Rubber duckies finally make a quack sound, totally ripped from Duck Game. They can also be pressed twice as fast as regular bike horns since their sound is shorter.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Foam, Sprays and the like can now move through tables, racks, computers, vending machines, and R&D machines.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixes xenomorph queen's neurotoxin projectiles not moving.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Viscerators now ignore the player who threw the grenade. If the player is a nuke op, they ignore other nuke ops as well.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Viscerators now have their sprite change its offset dynamically, just like bees.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Viscerators now have 66% chance to avoid projectiles (they'll still be hit if you clicked right on their sprite when you fired)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Singularities no longer try to pull lighting_overlays, and turfs no longer count toward the 100-items-pull-per-tick cap. AKA Fixed the "large singularities don't pull anything" bug.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sending bags of holding into singularities now creates EMPs instead of explosions. On top of that, it removes two thirds of the singularity's energy. If the Singularity is stage two or less (under 500 energy left) it will delete the singularity instead. In other words, Bags of Holding can now reliably destroy singularities, without blowing yourself up at the same time.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Explosions themselves still affect singularities like they used to (increase their energy, with a small chance of deleting them instead)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hookshots no longer cause Beepsky or ED-209 bots to chase their users.</li>

				<li class="wip">Attempted to make the threatment area in medbay less busy by compressing genetics and moving cryo away from the beds and closer to the entrance. Removed phalanximine from the map.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The AI core no longer eats half of the abandoned boxing ring.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The abandoned incinerator has been given its own (empty) APC and area, similar to the diner. The output pump leading into space has been moved inside.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Added a request console to the CE's office.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added ion rifles and shotguns along with some ammo to the armory.</li>

				<li class="wip">Moved robotics down to make room for a proper entrance to science, sadly this means robotics and rnd are no longer next to each other though still close. The door will also open to those with upload access and allows access to the AI upload. The core itself is still accessible only through robotics (or an additional door hack).</li>

				<li class="experiment">Changed movespeed modifiers, hyperzine and other magic sanic sources no longer make you the fastest around and merely give you a -10 tally for each you have so that means if you're fucked enough by cold pain or whatever you can still possibly move slower than you'd like while hopped up on stims.

				<li class="experiment">THE EXPERIMENTAL GUNS UPDATE IS LIVE!!</li>
				<li class="experiment">10 NEW ORIGINAL WEAPONS ADDED. Half of them can be obtained during any round, the other half have certain requirements. I won't go into details here. Have fun trying to get them all!</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug that caused the Power Gloves's electrical arc to be invisible, and refined its code so the arc looks much nicer.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reworked projectile pathing and appearance. Projectiles now follow a proper Bresenham path, which means you're less likely to hit something that you didn't intend to hit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Projectiles appear to follow a linear path, coders can force specific projectiles to not appear linear. The Captain's laser gun and the Retro laser gun's projectiles don't appear linear. (but still follow a Bresenham path)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Turrets, Mechas, and ED209 projectiles follow the new pathing as well.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Turrets now make noises when they fire.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Replaced recharger sprites. Players can see which gun is currently being recharged. They know also have a visibly different sprite when they are unanchored. You can longer place a gun in an unanchored recharger.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Syndicate RPG now uses an actual rocket launcher fire sound, instead of a shotgun sound. Fired RPG projectiles now pick up speed gradually over half a second instead of being at bullet speed from the get go.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Destroying projectiles such as pulse rifle beams can now also destroy tables.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All projectiles now have a penetration variable, and all objects/mobs have a penetration_dampening variable. What this means for example is that bullets will now keep going after hitting a window. Projectiles can be made to only penetrate certain types of atoms. When a projectile goes through a wall, it loses a bit of damage and leaves markings on it, those can be removed with a soldering tool.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All projectiles can now bounce off atoms. Beams now properly bounce off a player wearing an ablative armor. Ablative armor chance of deflection slightly increased. Energy based projectiles (such as ion bolts or electrodes), or staff of change/focus projectiles can be deflected as well.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed reinforced walls/girder being indestructible by destroying projectiles.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slightly increased the size at which items placed in display cases appear.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">You can now use bee nets by clicking on tiles instead of clicking on the item in your hand.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug that cause apiaries to feed WAY too much nutrients to the hydro trays near it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Apiaries still distribute and gather nutrients automatically, however, the "benefits" they give to nearby plants are now granted by the bees themselves. If a bee is above a plant ready for harvest, it'll halve its aging process so it remains alive longer, else it'll accelerate it so it becomes ready for harvest more quickly. It'll also halve the plant's weed and pest spread, and collect some of the plant's toxins for the apiary. (Toxins collected this way will find their way into the honeycombs, and will also drastically increase the sting power of bees).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added chapters to "The Ins and Outs of Apiculture - A Precise Art" manual that explains how to capture feral bees and how to harvest honeycombs.</li>
