		<li class="tweak">Change to body cavity surgery.  Can only put items in chest, groind and head. Max size for item - 3 (chest), 2 (groin), 1 (head). For chest surgery ribs should be bent open, (lung surgery until second scalpel step). Surgery step needs preparation step, with drill. After that you can place item inside, or seal it with cautery to do other step instead.</li>
