Stuff which is in development and not yet visible to players or just code related 
(ie. code improvements for expandability, etc.) should not be listed here. They 
should be listed in the changelog upon commit though. Thanks. -->

	<h3 class="author">TG updated:</h3>
	<ul class="changes bgimages16">
		<li class="wip">CONTRABAND-CON UPDATE: Added posters.</li>
                <li class="rscadd">POSTERS! Posters come in rolled packages that can adhere to any wall or r_wall, if it's uncluttered enough.
                <BR><BR>?How they get on-board: The quartermaster can now set the receiver frequency of his supplycomp circuit board. A bit simplistic as of now, will work on it later. Building a supplycomp with a properly set up circuitboard will give access to the Contraband crate.
                <BR><BR>?How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>?How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>?How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.
		<li class="tweak">Merged 'Game' and 'Lobby' tabs during pre-game into one tab</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Added the little red x to the late-join job list</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Late-joiners are warned if the shuttle is past the point of recall, and if the shuttle has already left the station</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Late-joiners now see how long the round has been going on.</li>
		<li class="tweak">Droppers are now used at the eyes, and thus, access to the eyes is required to have an effect.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Mining shuttle computer no longer spits out both 'Shuttle has been sent' and 'The shuttle is already moving' every time.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Adds a borg upgrade that increases their speed.  Requires gold.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Fixes autolathes not doing anything.</li>
		<li class="tweak">Changed Chief Engineers Office door name. Stop breaking in!</li>
		<li class="tweak">Added new airlocks to mining dock, research, and atmospherics.</li>
		<li class="tweak">RCDs are disabled if they are used on the escape shuttle or hyperspace around it.</li>
		<li class="tweak">EMPs will now cause flashes to flash their holder.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Heads now get a silver ID!</li>
		<li class="tweak">Blenders can now be filled directly from plant bags. Chefs rejoice.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">The biogenerator is now more robust. It can dispense fertilizer in batches, and make simple leather items at a high cost. Added more wood items for tower cap wood construction: Wooden doors and sandals. Added plump helmet biscuits and mushroom soup to kitchen recipes.</li>
		<li class="tweak">Watermelon and pumpkin biomass lowered a bit so biomass isn't totally trivial to acquire. </li>
