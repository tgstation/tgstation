		<li class="rscadd">Advance evolving diseases! Virology can now create, mutate and mix advance diseases together. I replaced the two bottles of blood in Virology with the advance disease. I'll write a wiki article soon enough. Here's a tip: Putting mutagen or virus food (a mixture of milk, water and oxygen) in blood with an existing disease will mutate it to gain symptoms. It can potentially lose old symptoms in the process, so keep backups!</li>

Eggs do the same; fully grown eggs will open to potential hosts. If you are still in the range of them, the facehugger inside will leap out and hug you. Removed "activate facehuggers", since it's useless now. Emote "roar" if you want to roar now.</li>
        <li class="rscadd">There can be only one living queen at a time, if the queen dies then a drone can take her place as a princess.</li>

        <li class="tweak">Aliens don't slip in space anymore.</li>
        <li class="tweak">Hulks don't paralyze aliens anymore, they instead slow them down to a slow crawl. It is very effective for punching aliens out of weeds, so it can't regenerate it's health.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">-Changes flour from an item to a container-held reagent. All recipes have been updated to use 5 units of reagent flour for every item required previously.   This has a few advantages: The 16(!) sacks of flour previously in the kitchen cabinet have been condensed to an equivalent 3 sacks. Beer is now brewable with universal enzyme, and converting lots of wheat into flour should be less tedious. Also, flour grenades, etc.  Because of this, flour is now obtained from the all-in-one blender rather than the processor, and spaghetti noodles are made with 5 units of flour in the microwave.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Cameras has changed quite a bit. They are no longer created from grenade canisters, instead you make them from an autolathe. The construction and deconstruction for them has also changed, so look it up or experiment it with yourself to see how to setup the cameras now. Cameras also get wires, like airlocks and APCs. There's two duds, a focus wire, a power wire, an alarm wire and a light wire. Protip: You can see which one is the alarm wire by pulsing it.</li>

You'll find the EMP-Proof and Motion cameras in the normal places (Singularity Pen & EVA), the new X-ray cameras can be found in the Dormitory and Bathrooms, plus some extra ones to invade your privacy.

		<li class="tweak">Alien Larva can bite simple animals (see: Ian, Runtime, Mice) to kill them and gain a small amount of growing points.</li>

		<li class="experiment">New lighting. It should look and feel the same as the old lighting whilst being less taxing on the server. Space has a minimum brightness (IC starlight) and areas that do not use dynamic lighting default to a lighting level of 4, so they aren't dark, but they aren't superbright. Replacing turfs should preserve dynamic lighting. Singulo/bombs should cause a lot less lighting-related lag. There are some minor known issues, see the commit log for details.</li>

Because every Z level needs these relays, which are linked up with Receivers/Broadcasters, every Z level will get one. There is one in the station, in the RD's office, one in Telecomms as always, one in the Ruskie station which is turned off and hidden from the HUB's linked list.

		<li class="wip">I'm currently working on cleaning up and moving around a large portion of the mob code. These changes do not directly affect players; HOWEVER, bugs, oversights or simple mistakes may cause problems for players. While I have tested as much as I can, there may be some lingering bugs I have missed. <p> This part of the mob code cleanup mainly focuses on damage variables and procs. So if you suspect something related to taking, dealing or examining damage is not working as intended please fill out an issue report <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/issues/list">here</a> and be as detailed as possible. This includes what you were doing, steps to reproduce the problem, who you were doing it to, what you were using ect... Thank you.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Alien hunters will now cloak when using the 'stalk' movement intent. Whilst cloaked they will use up their plasma reserves. They can however cloak as long as they like. Using the Lay-down verb will allow them to remain cloaked without depleting their plasma reserves,  hence allowing them to lay ambushes for unsuspecting prey. Should a hunter attack anybody, or get knocked down in any way,  they will become visible. Hopefully this allows for more strategic/stealthy gameplay from aliens. On the other hand, I may have totally  screwed the balance so feedback/other-ideas are welcome.</li>
		<li class="rscdel">Removed the invisibility verb from the alien hunter caste. </li>

		<li class="wip"><font color="purple"><b>Massive Mob-Icon Overhaul:</b><br>A large amount of the mob code has been replaced. The systems replaced were causing immense performance issues so the following are very necessary optimisations.<br>However, there is a downside: SS13 code is the equivilant of monkeys on typewriters. Despite weeks of constant coding/testing there -will- be things I've missed. The kinds of bugs I'm expecting are overlays not updating and/or in rare cases things not appearing in your hud. Most of these issues can be worked around simply by dropping the item and picking it back up. If all else fails ask an admin to regenerate your icons through view-vars.<br><u>Please</u> report any bugs to me on <b>#coderbus IRC</b> or <b>make an issue on the tracker</b> as a matter of urgency. I will fix them ASAP.<br>Also a massive thankyou to Nodrak, Erro, Pete and Willox. :)</font></li>
		<li class="tweak">Massive rewrite of the overlays system (particularly for humans). Stuff is cached and only updates when necessary. In effect this means faster updates, less overheads/lag, and less reliance on the game-ticker.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Numerous bugfixes and tweaks for damage-procs and damage-overlays for humans. They should now be almost seamless, use very little overhead and update instantly.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">TK grab can now be cancelled using the throw hotkey. (so now it toggles on/off like it used to).</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Added verbs to the view-var drop-down list: "Regenerate Icons" will fix a mob's hud/overlays. "Set Mutantrace" will change a mob's mutantrace.</li>

This <b>had</b> to be removed, there is work on a more fitting system, but this had to be taken out first regardless, and the longer people beat around the bush the worse the situation got.</li>
		<li>The gun change was made for no real reason and was pretty problematic, so reverting that should mean there are a lot less 'accidental suicides.'</li>
		<li>Tarjans were reverted by request as well, and since keeping them working after removing dismemberment would be a stupid amount of work.</li>

		<li class="wip">CONTRABAND-CON UPDATE: Added posters. I'm sorry to add it seperately with the rest of contraband, but there was a lack of sprites for everything else. Hopefully, people will gain interest and get me some damn sprites this way :3

                <BR><BR>How they get on-board: The quartermaster can now set the receiver frequency of his supplycomp circuit board. A bit simplistic as of now, will work on it later. Building a supplycomp with a properly set up circuitboard will give access to the Contraband crate.
                <BR><BR>How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.
