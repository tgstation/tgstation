			<h3 class="author">GunHog updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The Nanotrasen firmware update 12.05.14 for station AI units and cyborgs includes a patch to give them more control of their automatic speech systems. They can now chose if the message should be broadcasted with their installed radio system and any frequency available to them.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Paprika updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added winter coats and winter boots! Bundle up for space xmas! They are available in most wardrobe and job lockers, and come with special features depending on the flavor!</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Paprka updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new weapon for syndicate boarding parties, the C-90gl assault rifle. This is a hybrid rifle with a lot of damage and a grenade launcher alt-fire. Purchasable for 18TC.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Suppressors can now be used on the protolathe SMG and the C-20r.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">RemieRichards updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Sounds in areas of low pressure (E.g. Space) are now much quieter</li>
				<li class="tweak">To hear someone in space you need to be stood next to them, or use a radio</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">as334 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">We've discovered that slimes react to the introduction of certain chemicals in their bloodstream. Inaprovaline will decrease the slimes children's chance of mutation, and plasma will increase it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">We've also found that feeding slimes solid plasma bars makes them more friendly to humans.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Ergovisavi updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Allows using replica pods to clone people without bodies.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Speeds up replica pod cloning by adjusting the starting production.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Replica pods will now only create plantmen.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Mixing blood in a beaker or taking it from a suicide victim will render the blood sample useless for replica pod cloning.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">GunHog updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Our top Nanotrasen scientists have provided improved specifications for the Rapid Part Exchange Device (RPED)! The RPED can now contain up to 50 machine components, and will display identical items in groups when using its inventory interface.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Note that power cells, being somewhat bulkier, will take up more space inside the device. In addition, the RPED's firmware has also been updated to assist in new machine construction! Simply have the required components inside the RPED, apply it to an unfinished machine with its circuit board installed, and watch as the device does the work!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Nanotrasen has updated station bound Artificial Intelligence unit design specifications to include an integrated subspace radio transmitter. The transmitter is programmed with all standard department channels, along with the inclusion of its private channel. It is accessed using :o in its interface.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">{INCOMING CLASSIFIED SYNDICATE TRANSMISSION} Greetings, agents! Today, we are happy to announce that we have successfully reverse engineered the new subspace radio found in Nanotrasen's newest AI build plans. We have included our encryption data into these transmitters.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Should you be deployed with one of our agent AIs, it may be wise of you to purchase a syndicate encryption key in order to contact it securely. Remember, as with other agents, a Syndicate AI is unlikely to be of the same Syndicate corporation as you, and you both may actually have conflicting mission parameters! Your channel, as always, is accessed using :t.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Paprika updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Changed the way flashbang protection works. Currently, only security helmets (and their derivatives like swat and riot), and some hardsuit helmets have flashbang protection. Ear items like earmuffs and 'bowman' headsets (alternative, larger headsets) have flashbang protection as well, so you're able to go hatless as security. The Head of security, warden, and detective's hat do NOT have flashbang protection, but their earpieces do, from the 'noise' part of the flashbang. The flashbang blind still works as before, with only sunglasses/hardsuit helmets protecting you.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Tkdrg updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Security/Medical HUDs are now more responsive and less laggy.</li>

			<h2 class="date">10 November 2014</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Menshin updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Made meteors more threatening.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added three levels of danger for meteors waves, randomly selected at spawn.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Rumors speaks of a very rare meteor of unfathomable destructive power in the station sector...</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Paprika updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added a defibrillator and an EMT alternative clothing set for medical doctors. These defibrillators will revive the recently deceased as long as their souls are occupying their body and they have no outstanding brute or burn damage.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Yes, they actually work now too!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a way for you to unload a round from a chambered projectile weapon. Simply click on the gun when it is in your active hand, and assuming it does not have a magazine, the round should pop out. You can also use this system to unload individual bullets from magazines and ammo boxes, like the detective's speed loaders.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added glass tables and overhauled how table construction works. Now, you need to build a frame using either metal rods or wood planks, and then place a top on the table.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Table disassembly now works in two stages. Screwdriver the table to remove the top of it and reduce it back to a frame. Frames can be moved around and walked on top of. Wrench the table to deconstruct it entirely back to parts, this is quicker and much more like the old fashion. To deconstruct a frame, use your wrench on it as well.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed traitor med analyzers not fitting in medical belts.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed syringe box bug with medipens.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Perakp updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added escape-with-identity objective for changelings. Completion requires the changeling to have transformed to their target and be wearing an ID card with the target's name on it when escaping.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">You can use AI Upload modules directly on unslaved cyborgs to change their laws. The panel has to be open to do this.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Newly emagged cyborgs get locked down for a little bit until their new laws get shown. Thank you to whoever bitched about it on singulo and filed an issue report.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Paprika updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added an advanced mop for the janitor, available at the protolathe. This hi-tech custodian's friend can mop twice as many floor tiles before needing to return to your bucket!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Moved holosign projector to the protolathe and gave the janitor back his old signs. We hope you've enjoyed this free trial run of holo projectors, but our budget is tight!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a holosign projector to the janitor module for cyborgs.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Everything now drifts in space, not just mobs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mechs are just as maneuverable in space as you are.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Being weightless now slows movement down by a lot rather than speeding it up. Having your hands full will make movement even slower.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed spaceslipping (You slipped! x1000)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Jetpacking after being thrown out a mass driver will cancel out your momentum.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">In light of the recent achievements of the Robotics department, new and upgraded exosuit schematics were delivered to SS13 exosuit fabricators as a reward from CentComm.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The countless hours of research, experimentation, and reverse-engineering of wrecks from the mining asteroid have paid off - the Research team has rediscovered the process of building Phazon exosuits. The parts and circuits have been made available in the exofabs and circuit printers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The APLU Ripley exosuit has been refitted with asteroid mining purposes in mind. Its armour plating will provide extra protection against the brute attacks of asteroid alien lifeforms, and protect from gibtonite explosions. The leg servos were upgraded to provide faster movement.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are rumours of some creative shaft miners discovering a way of augmenting APLU Ripley armour with trophy hides from goliath-type asteroid lifeforms...</li>
				<li class="tweak">Durand construction routines now require a phasic scanner module and a super capacitor to match Nanotrasen industry standards.</li>

Large mobs (juggernaut, alien emperess, etc) don't fit, small mobs (mouse, parrot, etc) still fit in the same amounts, human-sized mob (humanoid, slime, etc) fit but maximum two per body bag and three for all the other closets. Adding bluespace body bag to R&D, it can hold even large mobs and in large amounts.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">We have managed to re-discover drones! We improved the formula, and have discovered some cool stuff.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">After some fiddling with audio recognition, drones can now understand human speech!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">One of our engineers found some screws that were loose on some of our tests, screwing them in made the drone work as if it had just come out of robotics.</li>
				<li class="tweak">We had to sacrifice some of our NT brand EMP protection for the speech recognition, so drones can get damaged if subjected to heavy EMP radiation.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">We figured out why drones couldn't remove objects from people, that has been fixed.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The standby light wasn't wired correctly.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Unfortunately one of our assistants tasked with transporting the only copy of the data dropped the flash drive in hot water because he wanted to see what "drone tea" tasted like. You'll have to discover them again.</li>

They are different from the ones they are used to in the following:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Their sight is better than ever, and now they can finally see things that are not directly pressed against them. Beware, they may appear more aggressive!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Their memory has also become better, and they will now remember the people who fed them. As a note, you need to grab the monkey or push it to show to the slime that you're giving it to them, and it's not just walking in.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Apparently, not only we have studied them, but they have also studied us. Slimes are now capable of showing various emotions, mimicking humans. Use it to your advantage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are reports of slimes showing signs of sentience. Further research is recommended.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">One of the reported signs is their speech capability. Following facts have been gathered: they talk more often to those who feed them; they react to being called by the number, but 'slimes' is also acceptable; they are able to understand being ordered to "follow" someone, or "stop". There is a report of slime releasing the assistant after a scientist shouted at it, and then calmly ordered a slime to stop.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">We've made a modification of a health scanner that is intended for the use on slimes. Two are available in the smartfridge.</li>

				<li class="experiment"><b>Sacrifice Cult - Cult has received a massive overhaul to how it works, focusing more on cult magics and sacrificing unbelievers. The most important changes are:</b></li>
				<li class="tweak">Cult starts off with alot more cultists, 6 cultists below 30 players and 9 above. The HoP can no longer be a round start cultist but is still convertible.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cultists start off with join, blood, self, and hell. These give the runes for the sacrifice and convert.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Conversions now require three cultists and converts no longer reward words, words must be obtained via sacrifice</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sacrificing players traps their soul in a soul stone, which can then be used on construct shells to implant the souls in them</li>
				<li class="tweak">Constructs shells can be summoned via a new rune (travel, hell, technology)</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer convert the sacrifice target, you dozzy sods</li>
				<li class="experiment">Summoning Narsie when she is not an objective leads to !!FUN!!</li>
				<li class="wip">Wrote a system to allow all mob types to be sacrificable - currently only corgis are in the new system</li>
				<li class="experiment">Holy Water will DECONVERT cultists, takes around 35 units and two minutes to succeed</li>
				<li class="experiment">Hitting a mob that contains holy water with a tome will convert that water to unholy water, conversely hitting any container that contains unholy water with a bible as chaplain will 'cleanse' the taint.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Unholy water works like a combination synaptazine and hyperzine, with a twist of branes dimarge and highly toxic to non-cultists</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Cargo can order a religious supplies crate - it contains flasks of holy water, candles, bibles, and robes</li>
				<li class="experiment">Cultists have an innate ability to communicate to the cult hive mind (BE AWARE - THIS DOES A LOT OF DAMAGE), cultists can also communicate via the new Commune option on their tomes (the Read Tome option has been shifted under the Notes option)</li>

		Unstable anomalies have been spotted in your region of space. These anomalies can be hazardous and destructive, though our initial encounters with these space oddities has discovered a method of neutralization. Method follows.<br>
<p>Step 1. Upon confirmation of an anomaly sighting, report its location. Early detection is key.<br>
		Step 2. Using an atmospheric analyzer at short range, determine the frequency that the anomaly's core is fluctuating at.</br>
		Step 3. Send a signal through the frequency using a radio signaller. Note that non-specialized signaller devices may possibly lack the frequency range needed.<br/></p>
		With the anomaly neutralized and the station brought out of danger, inspect the area for any remnants of the anomaly. Properly researched, we believe these events could provide vast amounts of valuable data.<br>
