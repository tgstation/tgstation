		<li class='rscadd'><b>Nanotrasen Anomaly Primer:</b><br>
		Unstable anomalies have been spotted in your region of space. These anomalies can be hazardous and destructive, though our initial encounters with these space oddities has discovered a method of neutralization. Method follows.<br>
		<p>Step 1. Upon confirmation of an anomaly sighting, report its location. Early detection is key.<br>
		Step 2. Using an atmospheric analyzer at short range, determine the frequency that the anomaly's core is fluctuating at.</br>
		Step 3. Send a signal through the frequency using a radio signaller. Note that non-specialized signaller devices may possibly lack the frequency range needed.<br></p>
		With the anomaly neutralized and the station brought out of danger, inspect the area for any remnants of the anomaly. Properly researched, we believe these events could provide vast amounts of valuable data.<br>

		<li class='rscadd'>We at Nanotrasen would like to assure you that we know the pain of waiting five minutes for the emergency shuttle to be dispatched in a high-alert situation due to our confirmation-of-distress policy. Therefore, we have amended our confirmation-of-distress policy so that, in the event of a red alert, the distress confirmation period is shortened to three minutes and we will hurry in preparing the shuttle for transit. This totals to 6 minutes, in hope that it will give our <b>very expensive equipment</b> a better chance of recovery.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Simplified detective stuff. The high-res scanner is gone and instead the detective's normal scanner will instantly report all fingerprints, dna and cloth fibers in full. This was needed because the system took too long to work with and disencouraged detectives. Not only that, it made detectives less of a threat for antagonists and made possible scenerios, such as framing someone by changing fingerprints with someone else, impratical. To replace the computer, the detective will have a full medical computer with access to it. Not only that, but his useless filing cabinet will be replaced with an empty one for serious investigators. Along with this, are fingerprint cards and built-in PDA scanning, as all of security had access to it which was really the detective's thing. The new scanner will also log every finding and you can print them out as a report by clicking the scanner while it is in your active hand.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">You can toggle the pressure of your sprayer by clicking on it while it is in your active hand. With pressure, the sprayer will spray 10 units on the floor, otherwise it sprays 5. You'll need to turn pressure on to spray water on the floor and make it slippery.</li>

		All admins have access to view-vars, player-panel(for individual mobs), game panel and secrets panel. Most of the things on those pages have their own rights requirements. For instance, you can only use event orientated secrets in the secret panel if you have FUN rights. Debug secrets if you have DEBUG rights. etc.<br>
		Spawn xeno and toggle gravity procs were moved into the secrets panel (fun).<br>
		<a href='http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/browse/trunk/config/admin_ranks.txt'>This</a> may help with understanding which flags do what. Unfortuanately it's still somewhat vague.<br>

This has a few advantages: The 16(!) sacks of flour previously in the kitchen cabinet have been condensed to an equivalent 3 sacks. Beer is now brewable with universal enzyme, and converting lots of wheat into flour should be less tedious. Also, flour grenades, etc.  Because of this, flour is now obtained from the all-in-one blender rather than the processor, and spaghetti noodles are made with 5 units of flour in the microwave.</li>

The systems replaced were causing immense performance issues so the following are very necessary optimisations.<br>However, there is a downside: SS13 code is the equivilant of monkeys on typewriters. Despite weeks of constant coding/testing there -will- be things I've missed. The kinds of bugs I'm expecting are overlays not updating and/or in rare cases things not appearing in your hud. Most of these issues can be worked around simply by dropping the item and picking it back up. If all else fails ask an admin to regenerate your icons through view-vars.<br><u>Please</u> report any bugs to me on <b>#coderbus IRC</b> or <b>make an issue on the tracker</b> as a matter of urgency.

This <b>had</b> to be removed, there is work on a more fitting system, but this had to be taken out first regardless, and the longer people beat around the bush the worse the situation got.</li>

                <BR><BR>How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.
