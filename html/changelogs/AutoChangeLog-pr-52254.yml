changes: 
  - refactor: "Converted everything to use setAnchored() as opposed to setting the anchored var directly. This means that COMSIG_MOVABLE_SETANCHORED can now actually be used reliably to track if an object's anchored var has changed."
  - bugfix: "The refactor also means that varediting the anchored var will now properly update most items' other states that rely on it being set a certain way."
  - bugfix: "Fixed bookcases having the incorrect icon when they're unanchored."
  - bugfix: "Fixed bookcases not automatically picking up spellbooks / storage books when made/spawned."
  - bugfix: "Fixed bookcases not dropping spellbooks / storage books when deconstructed."
