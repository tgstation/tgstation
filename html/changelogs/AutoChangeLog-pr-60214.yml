  - qol: "AI now opens the holopad with left click, and projects a hologram with right click. AI's right clicking the holopad will immediately project, no more double clicking"
  - rscadd: "AI's right clicking any holopad while projected via the \"Project Hologram?\" button when presence is requested, will cancel the projection and put their camera back to where they started (moving far away from the pad will not do this, nor would ctrl-clicking the pad)"
  - rscadd: "when an AI's presence is requested to a holopad they get a chat message that has two options, jump to the location, works as it does currently, and \"Project Hologram\" which will immediately project a hologram there, right clicking the pad will move you back to where you were"
  - rscadd: "Ctrl+leftclicking on the holopad will end the holopad call directly without jumping you back to your last location (it does nothing if you are not already a hologram)"
  - qol: "AI's can now examine a holopad to see the AI specific controls for the pads (need to shift+right click and examine from the menu, cant shift-click examine, issue with how the AI itself functions.)"
  - qol: "when you jump to someone from their name in chat, or a location from chat such as when presence is requested, you can hit \"~\" or \"0\" to jump back"
  - qol: "when you jump back to your previous location with the \"Jump Back\" key or to a saved location with \"1-9\" it stops all following, so you can jump back or jump to a location and you wont jump back to the person you tracked"
