changes: 
  - bugfix: "Secure safes no longer show up as weapons (I'm labelling this as a fix because I don't know any scenarios where you'd even be able to use a secure safe as an item, so its force value seemed unnecessary)"
  - bugfix: "PKAs and their derivatives (Ebows) now properly give info after the first shot"
  - bugfix: "Energy guns with no charge now properly give their info"
  - bugfix: "Energy guns that do stamina damage and regular damage now display a line in consideration of both the stamina and regular damage"
  - bugfix: "Conditional plurals in weapon description code have been fixed"
  - code_imp: "Added a proc to initialize a list of object subtypes keyed to their object paths"
  - code_imp: "Turned Hits_To_Crit into a define"
  - code_imp: "Improved the clarity of some comments, along with adding some where they were previously missing"
  - qol: "A gun's weapon notes now gives you the notes of its magazine, which gives you the notes of its ammo, making it so you don't need to take out ammo to see its damage."
