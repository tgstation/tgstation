  - balance: "Replaces the hardcoded material restriction for exporting protolathe designs to autolathes with a variable that does the same when set FALSE. Energy bolas, gun part kits, tele shield, enegy bolas and jaws of life currently have it set FALSE. TL;DR: You can export designs like bluespace cells to autolathes."
  - qol: "Added a chat feedback when unable to import designs to autolathes."
