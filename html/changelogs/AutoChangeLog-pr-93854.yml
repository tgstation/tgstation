changes:
  - refactor: "Refactored the entire blood system. Shit is extremely likely to break, so report any issues."
  - bugfix: "Some previously broken blood effects have had fixes. Way too many to jot them all down."
  - bugfix: "Blood trails can no longer be used to duplicate blood."
  - balance: "Blood trails scale directly on your bleeding rate now, alongside the old brute damage scaling."
  - balance: "While you can technically still die from too much blood, reaching that state is now impossible."
  - balance: "The autopsy scanner can now read blood information from husks, similarly to normal health analyzers."
