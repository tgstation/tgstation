  - rscadd: "After receiving many complaints about mimes who never pantomime, Nanotrasen has liquidated its mime personnel and hired new mimes who know more routines."
  - rscadd: "The mime gets the choice of two new spells: Invisible Chair and Invisible Box. They work much like the Invisible Wall spell does and disappear after a short span of time. The invisible chair can be buckled to like usual chairs; the box works like a standard inventory box item."
  - tweak: "Mime spells are now granted via a spellbook that starts out in the mime's inventory. Mimes can choose one of these three."
