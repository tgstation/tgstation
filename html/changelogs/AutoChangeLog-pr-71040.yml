  - qol: "Jukebox music can be controlled by a new seperate preference, and is no longer linked to the instrument sound preference option."
  - refactor: "Sound related toggle preferences have been migrated away from the legacy system. Pre-existing preferences should be safely migrated but players are advised to check."
