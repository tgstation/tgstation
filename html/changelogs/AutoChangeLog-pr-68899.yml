  - refactor: "A lot of food which was 'gross' is now 'gore'."
  - balance: "'Gore' is disliked by Humans and Moths, but liked by Lizards and Felinids. Lizards no longer like 'gross' food."
  - balance: "All butchered player species are considered to be gore, only preferred by Lizards, Felinids, and people with Deviant Tastes. If you like the taste of your fellow crew, prepare accordingly."
