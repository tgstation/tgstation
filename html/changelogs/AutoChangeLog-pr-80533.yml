changes:
  - bugfix: "Camera circuits actually print pictures again!"
  - qol: "Camera circuits can now take pictures while on a carbon, whether held, hung around the neck, or sneakily hidden in either pocket. When held they try to deposit their pictures into the holder's hands if possible."
  - bugfix: "Camera circuits should now actually use the camera's x axis picture size, rather than using the camera's y axis picture size setting for both axis."
