changes:
  - rscadd: "Surgery has been REWORKED ENTIRELY"
  - rscadd: "Surgery is now STATE BASED. What does this mean? Well, when you start surgery, you apply drapes and then make an incision. Then you can either retract skin or clamp bleeders. Once you retract skin you gain access to outer cavity operations, then once you saw the bones, inner cavity operations."
  - balance: "If your vessels are unclamped, you bleed pretty fast. Clamp those blood vessels fast to stop blood loss in surgery."
  - balance: "Species which lack skin or bones allow you to skip surgical steps. Skeletons have no skin to incise, after all."
  - qol: "Nectrotic Revival now works with chemicals in the syringe used, rather than only chemicals in the patient."
  - qol: "You can close a surgery with sutures, rather than only a cautery."
  - qol: "You can no longer feed someone an organ who is undergoing an operation."
  - rscadd: "Many surgeries have received new names or flavor."
  - rscadd: "The operating computer has received major tweaks. It now shows all potential operations and the patient's current surgical state, highlighting any steps you could take next."
  - rscadd: "New surgeries are now available immediately upon research. Syncing is dead."
  - rscadd: "Organ fishing can now be complete in someone with an open cavity, rather than someone undergoing organ manipulation."
  - balance: "You can no longer fish a vital organ (the brain) out of someone."
  - rscadd: "Organ thrower mod now works on people with open cavities, rather than people undergoing organ manipulation."
  - rscadd: "Chestbursters now no longer gib people with open cavities, rather than people undergoing organ manipulation."
  - rscadd: "Xenomorphs now have CHITIN rather than FLESH. This means little besides indicating you need a saw to incise their skin."
  - rscadd: "Sterilizine and similar chemicals now have a set duration, 1 minute per unit applied, up to 5 minutes."
  - rscadd: "Medibot upgrades are now applied automatically on research. Syncing is dead."
  - rscadd: "Many mechanical surgeries targeting organs now require cybernetic organs rather than a cybernetic bodypart."
  - refactor: "Surgery has literally be rewritten from the ground up. If you see anything broken or weird looking, particularly with mechanical surgeries and medical cyborgs, please report it"
  - qol: "Examining yourself for injuries explains how to apply pressure to bleeding limbs"
