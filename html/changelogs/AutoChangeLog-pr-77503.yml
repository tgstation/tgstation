changes:
  - refactor: "Morphs are now basic mobs with a nice new ability to help you change forms rather than the old shift-click method, much more intuitive."
  - admin: "With the morph rework comes a new ability you can add to mobs, \"Assume Form\". Feel free to add that to any simple or basic mob for le funnies as Runtime turns into a pen or something."
