  - rscadd: "Hygiene, you slowly become dirty over time, the more covered in blood you are the faster you will lose hygiene. When you are too dirty you will have a stink overlay. (Hygiene doesn't affect mood currently) It also spawns miasma slowly if you smell like shit."
  - rscadd: "adds NEET and neat traits. NEET's get 20 bucks social welfare extra and like being unhygienic, while neat people dislike being unhygienic and like being hygienic"
