changes: 
  - rscadd: Added superglue. It can be applied to any item to make it unable to be dropped. Undroppable items can't be put in machines, thrown or dropped. However, they can still be eaten, disassembled or (in case of stacks) separated.
  - rscadd: Clown and mime traitors may purchase a bottle of superglue (one time use) for 3 telecrystals.
