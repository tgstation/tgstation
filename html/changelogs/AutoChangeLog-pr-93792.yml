changes:
  - map: "CATWALK - Bridge - New location and new layout, now feels impressive and should be better for those scenes that take places there, bit more gravitas, it also contains an escape route behind 2x high security doors, or could it be an attack route in?"
  - map: "CATWALK - Command Meeting Area - Now is a more central location, no point having meetings on the bridge itself, have them in the meeting room with some style"

  - map: "CATWALK - Gateway - Re-decorated and tweaked a little"

  - map: "CATWALK - Hallways - New floor tiles featuring the dreaded catwalks, A more central landmark to identify when in the central area, may be divisive opinion wise. A few layout changes and tweaks"
