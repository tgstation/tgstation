changes:
  - bugfix: "Trying to insert an item into a vendor that has reached its maximum capacity for that item no longer says \"no space for any more /list\", and no longer TRIES to say it has too much of that category. It now correctly says it can't accept any more of that item."
  - bugfix: "Trying to insert an item into a vendor that can hold it but you can't put it in no longer both says you insert the item into its input compartment while also sending an error message about not being able to put it in."
  - bugfix: "Trying to insert an item into a vendor that can't hold it no longer sends the error message twice."
