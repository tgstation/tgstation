changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixed sm space exposure damage going through walls"
  - rscdel: "got rid of the molar multiplier for sm heating damage. It will now only impact molar damage and temp limit. We apply the lowest value directly so this slows down sm delams a tiny bit."
  - rscdel: "got rid of cascades making sm delam at 450 moles and 1250 mev. It delams normally now."
  - balance: "Applied the sm damage hardcap of 1.8 individually to heat (1.5), moles (1), power (1). Meaning most sm delams are slower now, but the really bad ones can be faster."
  - balance: "Halved sm temp healing across the board. Temp limits are still the same though so you shouldn't notice it that much."
  - balance: "Halved SM power damage across the board."
  - balance: "Changed sm space exposure damage to just check for the current tile and adjacent atmos connected tiles."
