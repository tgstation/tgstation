  - balance: "Flesh Spiders heal automatically over time if they go a short time without taking damage, instead of healing large chunks by clicking themselves and waiting two seconds."
  - qol: "Spider egg clusters which only hatch into one kind of spider don't ask you to select that one type from a radial menu with one option on it."
  - qol: "As a Flesh Spider, the game now tells you how you can heal yourself."
