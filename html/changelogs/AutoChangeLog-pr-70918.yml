  - qol: "the mech orbital pad now no longer deorgans you if you stand on it while it launches upward, now gibbing (!!!), but only when a mech falls on you"
  - qol: "the mech orbital pad can be used by mechs, and after 5 seconds of careful computer manipulation with your big mech arms, you can launch yourself"
  - qol: "mechs now give you feedback on what you fucked up when trying to attach equipment"
  - bugfix: "you can now melee attack as a mech when you dont have weapons equipped, as opposed to only being able to do it with weapons equipped"
  - rscadd: "you can now lock mech orbital pads with wirecutters, preventing mechs with pilots from launching, allowing only empty mechs"
