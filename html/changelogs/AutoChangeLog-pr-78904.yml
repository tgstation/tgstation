changes:
  - bugfix: "Examining twice experiment handlers with an active fish-related experiment now gives a comprehensible, correctly spaced list of scanned species rather than something like \"pufferfishguppyslimefishchasmchrab\"."
  - bugfix: "No more \"line snapped\" balloon messages everytime the fishing minigame is over"
  - bugfix: "Getting to the Master level of the fishing skill now correctly gives you that slight helping hand to identify yet-to-be-caught fishes."
