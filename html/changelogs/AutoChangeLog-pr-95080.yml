changes:
  - refactor: "Rewrites how addiction points are applied from reagents. Some reagents may be marginally more or less addictive as a consequence."
  - balance: "Addiction gained per metabolism tick now scales to the amount of reagents metabolized. In other words if you metabolize 0.2 units instead of the expected 0.4 units, you get 0.5x of the amount of addiction gain. This ultimately changes very little and I would imagine it's how most people expected it to work in the first place..."
