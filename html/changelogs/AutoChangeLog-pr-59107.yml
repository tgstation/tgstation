changes: 
  - rscadd: "There are now over a dozen new plant traits, but they're not really new. A bunch of unique plant behaviors (like holymelon's anti-magic) are now un-graftable, un-shearable, un-mutatable plant traits that show up on the plant analyzer now."
  - qol: "The plant analyzer now differentiates between traits you can mess with and traits you cannot."
  - balance: "Killer Tomatos no longer have liquid contents naturally."
  - balance: "Liquid Contents and Hypodermic Prickles are no longer compatible with one another. They already didn't work together in most cases, this just makes it so you need an extra step to make Liquid Contents Deathnettles."
  - bugfix: "Novaflowers now apply their on hit effects again."
  - code_imp: "Autodoc'd grown food / plant gene code"
  - refactor: "Refactored grown food / plant gene code"
  - admin: "A bunch more botany grief stuff is logged now"
