changes: 
  - rscdel: "Removed the broken pressure power multiplier which always evaluates to 2. Multiplied base SM power production by 2."
  - rscdel: "SM will no longer gain power when exposed to space. It actually used to do that, but only when the tile it's on has gas so you don't really notice it."
  - qol: "added the factor breakdowns to the SM ui."
  - qol: "added the gas effect breakdowns to the SM ui."
  - qol: "Made the supermatter selection in NT CIMS ui frontend based. Notifications will be based on you pressing the bell button instead of opening a SM page."
  - code_imp: "Instead of showing the environment breakdown of the SM tile, the NT CIMS will show you the exact gas mixture that it uses for calculation."
  - code_imp: "Total moles in NT CIMS will now be substituted with absorbed moles, which is the thing we use to calculate scrung delams. Scrungs at 1800."
  - balance: "Unified the SM taking damage on space (last modified 2018) with SM taking damage around space (added 2020, last modified 2022). Chose the latter formula, it's significantly stronger."
  - balance: "SM will start healing at the same damage at which it stops taking heat damage. Instead of the old fixed healing at ~313K."
  - balance: "made the low mole heat resistance thing on SM not scale with heat resistant gases."
  - balance: "Made the supermatter temperature power gain multiplier thing linear at 1/6 instead of 50/273 or 30/273."
  - balance: "Psychologist heat reduction is weaker on high heat gas."
  - refactor: "rerouted how external damage (bullets) and external power (emitter) is applied to SM."
  - refactor: "restructured the internal power calculations for SM. Power should be applied on each atmos tick instead of separately."
  - refactor: "restructured how the SM calculates the damage that it takes. No changes expected except for the low mole temp limit multiplier thing."
  - refactor: "Restructured SM pluox generation and miasma consumption. No changes expected though."
