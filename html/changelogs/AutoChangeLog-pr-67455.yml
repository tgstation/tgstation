  - config: "Hey, server operators! Title music playing at the lobby screen is now DISABLED by default in the config settings (game_options.txt). If you are not hearing any title music, be sure to adjust your config. If you're a player reading this and are sorely missing out on those soulful tunes, please notify your server's administration team of this change so they can diagnose it properly from there."
