  - balance: "Harnessing Shoreline Quay (bluespace energy, probably), a mystical energy (total bullshit) that permeates the Astral Waterways (bluespace quantum dimensions, probably), Sleeping Carp users can now once against deflect projectiles with their bare hands when focused in on battle (in combat mode)."
  - balance: "The Keelhaul technique is now nonlethal (a philosophical acknowledgement of the familial bond of sleep and death), but causes the target to become temporarily blind and dizzy along with its previous effects."
  - balance: "Sleeping carp users, while in combat mode, deal Stamina damage with their grabs and shoves. If the target of their grab has enough Stamina damage (80), they are knocked unconscious from a well placed nerve pinch."
  - balance: "Sleeping carp users find it very hard to wake up once they fall asleep...."
