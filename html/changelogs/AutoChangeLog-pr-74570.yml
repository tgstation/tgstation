Additionally, they will damage the limb for a little brute and some burn.\nEMPs on robotic limbs will now disable them for 10-20 seconds rather than causing a 10-20 second full stun on the user. Additionally, they will damage the limb for a little brute and some burn."
  - balance: "Arm EMPs don't do anything special as the limb being disabled already drops items."
  - balance: "Leg EMPs cause a 10-20 second knockdown, only really applicable if there's only one robotic leg as two disabled legs KD you anyways."
  - balance: "Chest EMPs cause a 3-6 second standing-up paralyze, visible to the player by a quite noticeable shaking of their body."
  - balance: "Head EMPs break the optical transponder circuits for 7.5-15 seconds, effectively giving the user nightmare goggles vision with green instead of red as the only remaining color."
