  - qol: "Nuclear Operatives successfully nuking the station now has its unique cross station news report again, and no longer uses the generic \"The station was nuked\" report."
  - qol: "Nuking the station to stop a blob infection now has a unique cross station news report again. Good luck convincing admins to allow this."
