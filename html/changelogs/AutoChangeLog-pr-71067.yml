  - balance: "Splits the nuclear operative combat medical kit into two versions: basic and premium."
  - balance: "Basic contains additional amounts of basic c2 chem patches, some spare atropine autoinjectors, sutures and regen mesh, and some basic medical equipment for tending wounds. 4 TC (as it was before)."
  - balance: "The premium kit is a far more useful full suite of advanced medical equipment, MODsuit modules, medical supplies and cybernetic implants, including the combat hypospray and the combat defib. 15 TC."
  - balance: "Atropine stops bomb implants from automatically detonating on death. You can still manually activate your bomb implant (even when you are dead)."
  - balance: "Operatives start with an atropine pen to stop themselves and their allies from detonating so they can hopefully be saved by a medical operative."
  - rscadd: "There is a pamphlet to explain this in the nuclear operative's survival box."
  - rscadd: "I'm not telling you to read the pamphlet, but you should probably read the pamphlet."
