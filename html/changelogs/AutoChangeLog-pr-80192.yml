  - qol: "For admins, in the \"Spawn Atom\" window where you pick atoms to spawn-by-type, anything that is a subtype of `/mob/living/basic` should now be replaced with the `BASIC` tag instead (like with carbons, reagent containers, turfs, etc.). So, instead of having to scroll through and try and figure out what that weird subtype of Poly is, it should now be easier to read in that smaller screen."
