  - balance: Plant instability can no longer cause the value of the instability stat
      to change randomly unless instability is >=80
  - balance: Plants can no longer mutate their stats twice in one tick starting at
      40 instability - though the degree to which stats mutate is still increased
      at the 40 mark, that is unchanged.
  Y0SH1M4S73R:
  - refactor: Painting has been significantly refactored with a new UI that should
      provide every painting control you need without having to unfocus the UI window.
      Please report any issues.
  - refactor: Items that can store paint palettes now start with no colors. Colors
      can be added to and removed from the item's palette, up to the number of colors
      they previously stored.

      by cultists to spawn different weapons based on how many unique cultists the

  - qol: The holy skateboard can be renamed like other null rod variants can
  - bugfix: Unusual null rod variants like the holy skateboard and bow can now be
      sacrificed by cultists to spawn different weapons based on how many unique cultists
      the chaplain has crit or killed with them. The bow and the burdened chaplain's
      revolver, in particular, also count cultists crit or killed by arrows/bullets
      fired from them by the chaplain.

  Bugwasabi:
  - bugfix: Play Internet Sounds will now only display song details to users who have
      admin music enabled.
  Melbert:
  - balance: Stasis now stops addiction ticks while active - meaning addictions will
      not apply their ticking withdrawal effects, but also won't heal over time
  - refactor: Refactored how deafness is tracked. Please report any weird interactions
      with sounds, like messages or sfx being missing.
  - bugfix: Lacking ears and being in hard crit now consistently treats you as "being
      deaf". This affects a few minor interactions like empath, the jukebox, and sleeping.
  lelandkemble:
  - bugfix: the Space Furnace is now usable in rooms that have previously been breached,
      provided they have recovered enough air.
2026-02-07:
  ArcaneMusic:
  - rscadd: Stations can now spawn with Structural weakpoints. If they're subject
      to an explosion, they'll crack open a tear in the station's turfs. If you spot
      one, make sure to weld it or seal it with sticky tape to fix one. Or not!
  - rscadd: Adds a negative station trait that greatly increases the number of weakpoints
      that can spawn on station.

2026-02-11:
  Cerulyss-Aureon:
  - qol: The HFR can now produce Tier 5 gases at Level 4 when plasma is present in
      the moderator. This makes it a more viable and competitive alternative to traditional
      pipe or chamber gas synthesis.
  Iajret:
  - bugfix: fixed brain not getting traumas from brain damage (including rotting or
      chemicals)
  - bugfix: brains should no longer be getting traumas from mannitol healing
  - bugfix: apparently cut stomach healing had been broken too, and it should be fixed
      now.

2026-02-13:
  Cyberboss:
  - bugfix: Fixed some inconsistencies with bodytypes when non-binary genders had
      it set to "Use gender". This is no longer possible. If you use have previously
      used this setting, your bodytype will be explicitly set to female.
  LT3:
  - code_imp: Removed unused rock the vote config entry
  SyncIt21:
  - refactor: plumbing automatic buffer has been refactored for better performance
      & interactions. report bugs on github

  - bugfix: AI display selector displays them correctly
  Cyberboss:
  - bugfix: The Kommand action icon will now properly reflect your pointer colour
      after being reset.
  Melbert:
  - refactor: Rewrites how addiction points are applied from reagents. Some reagents
      may be marginally more or less addictive as a consequence.
  - balance: Addiction gained per metabolism tick now scales to the amount of reagents
      metabolized. In other words if you metabolize 0.2 units instead of the expected
      0.4 units, you get 0.5x of the amount of addiction gain. This ultimately changes
      very little and I would imagine it's how most people expected it to work in
      the first place...
  - rscdel: Cytology creations no longer have a random chance to fail if another sample
      in the vat has growth process. All growth is still reset on any successful creation.
      As growth failure has been removed, some cell lines that had unique fail interactions
      have been altered.
  - rscadd: Clown cell lines are now all boosted by supplying mutagen. However, using
      mutagen may cause a mutant clown to spawn. (Before, failure caused a mutant
      clown to spawn.)
  - rscadd: Queen bee lines now alternate between spawning a queen bee and a swarm
      of bees. (Before, failure caused a swarm of bees to spawn.)
  - rscadd: Cytology created bees have a rare chance of having a random toxin.
  - rscadd: When you get absorbed by a changeling, you get made into an imaginary
      friend of the changeling that absorbed you.
  - refactor: Refactored how people are returned to their bodies after occupying separate
      bodies, such as bitrunners and ghost roles. Report any oddities or failure to
      return correctly.
  lelandkemble:
  - map: Meta's cryo waste pipe is connected to main waste pipes
  matchalabubu67:
  - bugfix: radio uplinks now generate three word codes instead of one
  vinylspiders:
  - bugfix: fixes certain particle effects not triggering under certain conditions
2026-02-15:
  Melbert:
  - rscadd: Adds Tourniquets. While attached to a limb, reduces blood loss from that
      limb by 90%, but makes you walk / interact slower. (Or if you put it on your
      head, you die.)
  - rscadd: You can purchase Tourniquets from the premium section of the medical vendor
  - rscadd: 'Paramedic belt setup has changed yet again: Surgical tape replaced with
      Tourniquet, Bone gel replaced with Bonesetter.'
  - rscadd: You can use all forms of tape as splint - like Gauze. Will secure a fracture
      but won't stop your blood from exiting.
  - refactor: Refactored gauze entirely, report any strangeness with it (or tape,
      or tourniquets)
2026-02-16:
  Arturlang:
  - bugfix: moon heretics getting hit by things that target limbs specifically (like
      vendors) will no longer bypass moon robe protection, but, good luck surviving
      that.

  - code_imp: Cleaned up some tram signal code
  Y0SH1M4S73R:
  - rscadd: Anomaly cores now have effects when pulsed by an assembly, button, or
      wire. These effects are generally weaker versions of the effects of the source
      anomalies, or of their respective reactive armors, and many have a 50% longer
      cooldown than said armors.
