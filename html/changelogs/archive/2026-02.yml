      the moderator. This makes it a more viable and competitive alternative to traditional
      pipe or chamber gas synthesis.
  Iajret:

      chemicals)

  Cyberboss:

      after being reset.
  Melbert:
  - refactor: Rewrites how addiction points are applied from reagents. Some reagents
      may be marginally more or less addictive as a consequence.
  - balance: Addiction gained per metabolism tick now scales to the amount of reagents
      metabolized. In other words if you metabolize 0.2 units instead of the expected
      0.4 units, you get 0.5x of the amount of addiction gain. This ultimately changes
      very little and I would imagine it's how most people expected it to work in
      the first place...
