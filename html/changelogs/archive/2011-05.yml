  /tg/station team:
  - unknown: ' AMURRICA FUCK YEAH day - Dangercon update'
  Agouri and Erro updated(I'm in the DangerCon team now, nyoro~n :3):
  - unknown: Backpacks removed from all players. It was unrealistic. You can now had
      to the living quarters to get one from the personal closets there.
  - unknown: Any firearms now send you to critical in 1-2 shots. Doctors need to get
      the wounded man to surgery to provide good treatment. Guide for bullet removal
      is up on the wiki.
  - unknown: Brute packs and kelotane removed altogether to encourage use of surgery
      for heavy injury.
  - unknown: Just kidding
  - unknown: Fireaxe cabinets and Extinguisher wall-mounted closets now added around
      the station, thank Nanotransen for that.
  - unknown: Because of Nanotransen being Nanotransen, the fire cabinets are electrically
      operated. AIs can lock them and you can hack them if you want the precious axe
      inside and it's locked. The axe itself uses an experimental two-handed system,
      so while it's <u><font color="red">FUCKING ROBUST</font></u> you need to wield
      it to fully unlock its capabilities. Pick up axe and click it in your hand to
      wield it, click it again or drop to unwield and carry it.You can also use it
      as a crowbar for cranking doors and firedoors open when wielded, utilising the
      lever on the back of the blade. And I didn't lie to you. It's fucking robust.
  - unknown: "Fireaxe, when wielded, fully takes up your other hand as well. You can't\
      \ switch hands and the fireaxe itself is unwieldy and won't fit anywhere. \n\
      \t\t"
  - unknown: A fireaxe cabinet can also be smashed if you've got a strong enough object
      in your hand.
  - unknown: "\n\t\t"
  - unknown: "<b>EXTINGUISHER CLOSETS</b>, made by dear Erro, can be found in abundance\
      \ around the station. Click once to open them, again to retrieve the extinguisher,\
      \ attack with extinguisher to place it back. Limited uses, but we've got plans\
      \ for our little friend.\n\t\t"
  - unknown: '<u>Sprite kudos go to: Cheridan for most of them, Khodoque for the fantastic
      fireaxe head. I merged those two. Also thanks to matty and Arcalane for giving
      it a shot.</u>'
  - unknown: <font size="2"><i>Has the piano got TOO annoying? Try the fire axe...</i></font>
  - unknown: 'Oh, and tou can now construct Light floors! To do it: Use wires on glass,
      then metal on the produced assembly, then place it on an uncovered floor like
      you would when replacing broken floor tiles. To deconstruct: Crowbar on light
      floor, use crowbar on produced assembly to remove metal, wirecutters to separate
      the wires from the glass. Sprites by delicious Hempuli.'
  - unknown: "Got something to bitch about? Got a bug to report? Want to create drama?\
      \ Did the clown destroy your piano while you were playing an amazing space remix\
      \ of the moonlight sonata? Give it <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/detail?r=1543\"\
      >here</a>\n\n\t"

  - unknown: In containers where there isn't a perfect ratio of reagents, reactions
      won't consume ALL of the related reagents (so if you mix 10 anti-toxin with

      10 tricodrazine)
  - unknown: '<font color="red">Catalysts</font>: some reactions might need presence
      of an element, while not directly consuming it.'
  - unknown: "Reactions changed to use catalysts: all recipes that require Universal\
      \ Enzyme now require 5 units of the enzyme but the enzyme isn't consumed (So\
      \ Tofu, Cheese, Moonshine, Wine, Vodka, and Kahlua recipes). \n\t"
  Errorage:
  - unknown: '<font color="red">Smooth tables</font>: Tables now automatically determine

      unless there is a window between them (regular, reinforced, tinted, whichever)'
