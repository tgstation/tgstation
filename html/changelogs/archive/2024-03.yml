  Absolucy, Melbert:

      you - Instead, it will clear 1 fire stack off of you every time you roll, with
      a roll every 0.8 seconds.
  - balance: Stop, drop, and roll no longer stuns you for 6 seconds. Instead, it will
      knock you to the floor while you are rolling. Moving around or getting up will
      cancel the roll, and you cannot use items while rolling around.

      get up.

      non-head PDA that has what you require to **do your job**.
  - bugfix: QM offices properly reflect their non-head status.
  - bugfix: Maid Cafe on Icebox had extra pipe causing a litany of issues. The extra
