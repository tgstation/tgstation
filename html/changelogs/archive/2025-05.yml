  Ezel/Improvedname, JohnFulpWillard:
  - balance: Cult daggers boomerang back to non-cultists who throw it.
  - balance: Flagellant's robes crushes non-cultists with gravity instead of forcing
      you to drop it on the floor.
  - balance: Zealot's blindfolds now rapidly causes eye damage to non cultists who
      try to wear it, instead of dropping it on the floor and giving a minute of temporary
      eye damage.
  FlufflesTheDog:
  - bugfix: Health analyzers properly function on patients with cybernetics
  Hatterhat:
  - qol: Shoving a rechargeable magazine into a recharger now has refill speed scale
      with part tier/recharge efficiency. This probably doesn't matter very much because
      no regularly-available gun uses rechargeable magazines.
  - spellcheck: Examining magazines should no longer have two instances of "The" prefixing
      a casing. Maybe. Probably.
  Holoo-1:
  - bugfix: fixed ampcheck in smes room computer, some overlapping cables and cameras
      on CatwalkStation. Also replaced bridges with pumps in atmos
  Jacquerel:
  - map: Adds some bots to Catwalkstation
  - bugfix: Standard Holoparasites will once again yell their battlecry and can rapidly
      punch windows.
  JohnFulpWillard:
  - admin: People throwing boomeranged items and hitting themselves now logs it as
      them hitting themselves (rather than being hit by the air).
  NecromancerAnne (Code, Mild Sprite Edits) Michiyamenotehifunana (Sprites):
  - image: Replaces the decrepit DRAGnet sprite with something newer and more interesting.
  - balance: Completely reworks the DRAGnet. They are now bulky energy guns.
  - balance: Snare is now a single shot bolt that deals 30 stamina force, staggers
      the target and lays out a net of teleportation fields that can transport anyone
      standing on them for too long to a DRAGnet beacon.
  - balance: Net has been replaced with a scattershot disabler round.
  SmArtKar:
  - bugfix: You can no longer fish for things in storages, or that you are unable
      to see
