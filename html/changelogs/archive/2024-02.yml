  carlarctg, Weird Orb, Ghommie, nikothedude, Jacquerel, MrMelbert, san7890, Helg2:
  - image: Heavily reworks and resprites first aid analyzers. They now display if
      they're happy, sad, angry, or warning you! Also a 'pricking' animation.
  - rscadd: First aid analyzers are now found in all basic and specialized medkits.
      Toxin medkits get a new* disease analyzer. Miners get a miner-colored one in
      their box.
  - balance: Scanning yourself with a first aid analyzer will 'create a holo-image
      with treatment instructions next to your wounds', doubling the speed of treatment
      of scanned wounds!
  - sound: Health analyzers and gene scanners now have a scanning sound, courtesy
      of CM.
  - refactor: Refactored some wound code to make treatment duration changes and changes
      in the description of wounds easier.
  - bugfix: Fixed a dummy parent feature of the health analyzer (Verbose mode) showing
      up, uselessly, on the disease and first aid subtypes.
  - image: Surgical processors and slime scanners have recieved a similar resprite.
  - bugfix: Woundscans no longer runtime
  - bugfix: Normal health analyzers can no longer give the first aid bonus when woundscanning
  - rscadd: Several common 'household' reagents can be used as improvised medicine
      treatment.
  - rscadd: Drinking tea will help mend (non-bone) wounds over time.
  - rscadd: Flour and corn starch may be splashed onto wounds to help dry them up,
      though they'll have a negative effect on burn wounds.
  - rscadd: Added a new reagent, saltwater, made by combining table salt with water.
  - rscadd: Table salt and saltwater can be splashed onto wounds as well, reducing
      bleeding and improving sanitization and disinfection significantly. However,
      the coarse undiluted salt will irritate the wounds, reducing clot rate and flesh
      healing, and both of the reagents will increase a burn wound's infestation rate.
  - rscadd: Altered Table Salt's recipe to just need sodium and chloride. Changed
      the recipe of Pentetic Acid and Heparin to need table salt (sodium x chloride)
      and thus slightly altered the total output of those reagents (pentacid went
      from 5u per reaction to 4u, heparin 4u->3u)
  - rscadd: Saline-Glucose Solution now needs 2u of saltwater and 1u of sugar, meaning
      the overall recipe should be completely unchanged in practice. Contact me on
      discord if any issues arise from these chemical changes!
  - qol: First aid analyzers now give easy-to-understand direct information, with
      the specific recommended treatments bolded in the analysis text. They also have
      a 'unique' extra bit of info, telling you about improvised ways to remedy your
      wound.
  - balance: Bone gel standart amount has been increased to 5.

2024-02-13:
  Absolucy:
  - rscadd: Painkillers (i.e morphine, miner's salve) now actually induce analgesic
      effects, preventing various pain-related effects, such as screaming due to pain,
      and also provides a speed bonus during surgery.
  - rscadd: The tenacity trauma (traumatic neuropathy) also applies analgesic effects.
  - refactor: Simplified code related to reagents adding traits.
  - qol: Prevent certain antagonists from being fucked over by associated phobias.
      Heretics (+minions) will ignore fear of heresy, magical antags will ignore fear

      (by around 2%), to compensate for the increased speed offered by the upgraded
      surgeries.

      Don't worry, it doesn't harm them, although they may find it annoying.
  AlbertNanotracen:
  - rscadd: Voltaic Yellow Wine - New "base" drink, found in booze-o-mat. No special
      effects besides acting as a weak ethereal food. Not very potent in terms of
      alcohol.
  - rscadd: Telepole - New mixed drink themed after thunderstorms, gives the same
      shock-resist grey bull does. Made from 1 part Voltaic Wine, 1 Part Sake, and
      2 parts Dark & Stormy. Moderately potent.
  - rscadd: Pod Tesla - New mixed drink, themed after the old removed tesla engine
      (the singulo gets a cocktail, it should too!) Grants a brave - bull phobia resist,
      and a stronger grey bull shock resist allowing you to (temporarily) resist tesla
      arcs from reactive armor and the SM's tesla coils. Gives a pleasant thought
      to whoever drank it, because this thing is a pain to make. Made from 5 parts
      admiralty, 5 parts telepole, and 3 parts brave bull. Highly potent.
  - qol: Unsure if this counts as QOL or balance, but the fact sol dry is in 3 different
      cocktails but the bartender has to buy 30u cans of it made me feel it deserved
      being added to the soda dispenser.
