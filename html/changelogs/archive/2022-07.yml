  Hamcha:
  - bugfix: The agent card now correctly allows you to take anyone's identity, even
      if their name contains numbers
  OrionTheFox:
  - bugfix: Chainsaws can now actually cut wood! So can the giant axe that is the
      PKC, and other chainsaw items - but, alas, esword handles alone can not, and
      you must actually turn them on. Also, all mining implements can mine scattered
      stones as well!

      their basic mask can be used for internals.
  - imageadd: New mime Hugbox!

      click on what you want to acid.

      no longer accidentally remove it.

      read.
  - balance: Sacred Flame now lets people around them know they're actually being
      made super flammable.

  - balance: Being Emotemute now prevents you from invoking spells which require emotes
      (mime spells).

      a brain. Most spells didn't work, anyways.

      anyways.
  - balance: You can't mindswap into PAIs and brains(?).

      of the "teleport" spell, instead of fake casting it.

      a Ghost Role is available. Intended for the few who really do need it.
  - admin: Admins get another additional preference where Suppress All Ghost Roles
      only works while they are currently in an adminned state. They will still get
      ghost rolls normally when they are in a deadminned state.
