      is a status effect now and gives better feedback to the user.

  Hamcha:
  - bugfix: The agent card now correctly allows you to take anyone's identity, even
      if their name contains numbers
  OrionTheFox:
  - bugfix: Chainsaws can now actually cut wood! So can the giant axe that is the
      PKC, and other chainsaw items - but, alas, esword handles alone can not, and
      you must actually turn them on. Also, all mining implements can mine scattered
      stones as well!
  - bugfix: Chainsaws are now faster when they are on, and slower when they aren't.
  Salex08:

  Guillaume Prata:
  - qol: Clown/Mime survival boxes won't have a mostly pointless breathing mask, as
      their basic mask can be used for internals.
  - imageadd: New mime Hugbox!
  Melbert:
  - rscadd: The Mjolnir wizard loadout no longer scams you. It now also grants 1 level

      always meant to have.

      loot books).

      advanced mimery.

      click on what you want to acid.
  - qol: Also, xenomorph larva now use a radial when choosing an evolution type.
  - qol: Summon Item now takes a few seconds to remove the mark from an item, so you
      no longer accidentally remove it.

      read.
  - balance: Sacred Flame now lets people around them know they're actually being
      made super flammable.

  - balance: Being Emotemute now prevents you from invoking spells which require emotes
      (mime spells).
  - balance: All wizard spells except Mindswap can't be cast if the wizard is just
      a brain. Most spells didn't work, anyways.
  - balance: PAIs and carded AIs can no longer cast spells. Most spells didn't work,
      anyways.
  - balance: You can't mindswap into PAIs and brains(?).
  - admin: Admins can now add spells by name or typepath.
  - admin: Spell requirements are bitflags now, so you can modify them with the bit-field
      VV ui. Pretty neat.

      of the "teleport" spell, instead of fake casting it.

  - refactor: Refactored how all item actions are applied and handled.

      a Ghost Role is available. Intended for the few who really do need it.
  - admin: Admins get another additional preference where Suppress All Ghost Roles
      only works while they are currently in an adminned state. They will still get
      ghost rolls normally when they are in a deadminned state.
