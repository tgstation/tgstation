  vincentiusvin:
  - code_imp: rescaled supermatter health from 900 to 100.
  - balance: we didn't do a 1:1 rescale of the damage though, atmos based damage should
      be slightly higher across the board but have lower caps. All external damage
      is slightly lower.
  - code_imp: made the less important parts of the visual supermatter effects same
      between different delams so we have an easier time changing the code.
  - qol: added a delta symbol to the SM UI on damage and energy breakdown to denote
      that they are actually changes instead of exact values.
