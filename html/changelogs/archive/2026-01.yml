      the teleport now picks a random tile up to 3 tiles away from the creation spot

      allowing you to hide in them.

  Hatterhat:

      delivered). These only alert for deaths on raw mining wasteland, and will not
      work in space, ruins, or on-station.
  - balance: Kheiral cuffs can now be attached to uniforms as accessories. They retain
      their suit sensor extension/GPS functionality (still only when off station Z-levels,

      table

      pizza.

      Peak, then it's actually faster.

      a dislocated limb. Same tools, same steps, but if you go through the effort

      on the floor.
