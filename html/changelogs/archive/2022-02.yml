      even fall at all!). This has been corrected to allow you to punt them down to

  Melbert:
  - rscadd: Large scale heretic revamp!
  - expansion: The Codex Cicatrix is no longer a roundstart heretic item. Research
      is handled through their antag info UI. Rune drawing is done by using a writing
      tool with Mansus Grasp active in your offhand. The actual Codex is an unlockable
      ritual item now.
  - expansion: The Living Heart is no longer a roundstart heretic item - their actual
      heart now becomes their Living Heart, and it makes a sound when triggered. Losing
      your heart (being disemboweled) will require you to do a ritual to regain it.

      mechanics as well as providing some helpful tips for newer players.

  - expansion: Heretic sacrificing  has been reworked. You can now sacrifice people
      who are in soft crit or weaker. Sacrificing someone heals them, cuffs them,

      to survive. Survive long enough and you return without memory - die, and your
      body will be thrown back.
  - expansion: Heretics now have a few new rituals, including the Ritual of Knowledge,
      a randomly generated ritual that awards knowledge points.

      know the Lord of the Night can eat arms to regain body parts and heal?

      you.
