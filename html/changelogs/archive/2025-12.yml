  Cyberboss:

  Ghommie:
  - refactor: Follow-up to the crafting/material refactor from months ago. All objects
      crafted with stacks now inherit their mat composition (not necessarily the effects
      and color) by default, while previously only a few things like chair, sinks
      and toilets did. Report any object looking or behaving weirdly as a result.
  - bugfix: The material composition of ammo boxes is no longer a 1/10 of what it's
      supposed to be. It was a shitty hack to make it harder to recycle empty ammo
      boxes. Instead, they lose materials as they're emptied now.

      me

      now properly updates your speed.
  Melbert:
  - balance: Tech storage access is no longer a "command level" access, meaning the
      HoP can give it to crewmembers that have a normal ID card. Note, secure tech
      storage still requires bridge access, which requires a silver ID card.
  - bugfix: Tie names are verified
  - bugfix: Fix mech construction

  - bugfix: Bolas don't slow while in hand
  - balance: Ammo will no longer show up in the Spy loot pool until a weapon that
      uses said ammo has been claimed. Some ammo for weapons easily obtainable on
      station (shotgun shot) are not limited by this restriction. Also, there's a
      rare chance ammo will show up anyways just to keep people on their toes.
  - balance: Claiming a weapon will refresh ammo in the loot pool that has already
      been claimed or cycled out.
  - balance: Bounty rewards that no Spy claimed have a chance to re-enter the loot
      pool after a bounty refresh, rather than being lost for the remainder of the
      round.
  - balance: When higher tier Spy bounties empty their loot pools, they will attempt
      to draw from lower tier pools before defaulting to telecrystals.
  - balance: Spies no longer are rewarded with gun cases for bounties; rather just
      the gun itself
  - spellcheck: Modified the Spy antag info text
  RikuTheKiller:

  - image: The DNR ghost HUD icon has gotten a new look.
  lelandkemble:
  - bugfix: Malf AI "Destroy RCDs" power now properly destroys mech RCDs
  san7890:
  - balance: After noticing it was too easy for animals to crawl through maintenance
      by abusing the Easy-Exit sensors, Nanotrasen has replaced all unrestricted door
      sensors (like in maintenance) with a pull-down lever that should take around
      2-3 seconds to engage. It has been designed to allow the employee to actuate
      it despite any pressure differentials within an area.
  - balance: The above change does not apply to select doors in the medical section
      of the station, which will continue to use the "older" Ready-Exit system.
  - sound: In order to ensure that staff in high-traffic areas don't go bonkers due
      to this new change, sound dampeners have been installed to prevent the hydraulics
      from being heard for super long distances. However, they skimped out on the
      quality for the ones in maintenance...

      This means blood wounds kill you slightly slower, but heal slightly slower.

      also 0.85x lower. Medicated sutures are unaffected.
  - balance: Bloody Mary's blood healing effect now scales with how drunk you are.
      Worse in low amounts, better in high amounts.

      of buttons AND hands produces different results, but all of them good. Experiment!
  - balance: Evil boxing now has a Sucker Punch. Hit someone from behind to potentially
      knock them out cold!
  - bugfix: Punching mitts no longer mention punching rocks.

  - balance: Romerol, when applied via touch or vapor, is now guaranteed to infect
      when using >=1u. (Prior, it had a % chance of infecting equal to the amount
      of chemicals use - so 1u meant 1% chance to infect.) Other methods of applying
      Romerol are unaffected (ingesting or injecting any amount is still a guaranteed
      infection).

  - qol: The world is now heavily desaturated while blind, rather than pure monochrome,
      to give players some visual stimulus

      type/version and the variant... abbreviation? Letter? One of the two.

  - bugfix: Fix map reader ignoring valid variable names. If a variable had a number
      inside the name anywhere the map reader would ignore this value when a map was
      loaded and use the initial value instead. This was due to a faulty regex pattern
      that did not properly match variable names.

  Melbert:
  - rscadd: Surgery has been REWORKED ENTIRELY
  - rscadd: Surgery is now STATE BASED. What does this mean? Well, when you start
      surgery, you apply drapes and then make an incision. Then you can either retract
      skin or clamp bleeders. Once you retract skin you gain access to outer cavity
      operations, then once you saw the bones, inner cavity operations.
  - balance: If your vessels are unclamped, you bleed pretty fast. Clamp those blood
      vessels fast to stop blood loss in surgery.
  - balance: Species which lack skin or bones allow you to skip surgical steps. Skeletons
      have no skin to incise, after all.
  - qol: Nectrotic Revival now works with chemicals in the syringe used, rather than
      only chemicals in the patient.
  - qol: You can close a surgery with sutures, rather than only a cautery.
  - qol: You can no longer feed someone an organ who is undergoing an operation.
  - rscadd: Many surgeries have received new names or flavor.
  - rscadd: The operating computer has received major tweaks. It now shows all potential
      operations and the patient's current surgical state, highlighting any steps
      you could take next.
  - rscadd: New surgeries are now available immediately upon research. Syncing is
      dead.
  - rscadd: Organ fishing can now be complete in someone with an open cavity, rather
      than someone undergoing organ manipulation.
  - balance: You can no longer fish a vital organ (the brain) out of someone.
  - rscadd: Organ thrower mod now works on people with open cavities, rather than
      people undergoing organ manipulation.
  - rscadd: Chestbursters now no longer gib people with open cavities, rather than
      people undergoing organ manipulation.
  - rscadd: Xenomorphs now have CHITIN rather than FLESH. This means little besides
      indicating you need a saw to incise their skin.
  - rscadd: Sterilizine and similar chemicals now have a set duration, 1 minute per
      unit applied, up to 5 minutes.
  - rscadd: Medibot upgrades are now applied automatically on research. Syncing is
      dead.
  - rscadd: Many mechanical surgeries targeting organs now require cybernetic organs
      rather than a cybernetic bodypart.
  - refactor: Surgery has literally be rewritten from the ground up. If you see anything
      broken or weird looking, particularly with mechanical surgeries and medical
      cyborgs, please report it
  - qol: Examining yourself for injuries explains how to apply pressure to bleeding
      limbs
  - refactor: Refactored death moodlet, report any oddities
  - balance: Golems have a whopping 0.5x modifier to brute and burn damage, but no
      longer have a 0.9 modifier to tox / oxy damage.
  - balance: Golems have a new 0.6x modifier to stamina damage and stun duration,
      but also a new 1.2x modifier to knockdown duration.
  - balance: Golems can no longer be defibrillated. Revival surgery is... untouched,
      I guess.
  - balance: Golems can be revived by applying materials to their body. Each sheet
      restores some brute and burn damage, as well as some nutrition. When sufficient
      brute, burn, and nutrition are restored, they are revived!
  - balance: Golems can no longer fall into soft crit. They can still enter hard crit
      and die when taking sufficient damage, though.
  - balance: When a golem is attacked with brute or burn damage, they sustain direct
      nutrition drain based on how much damage dealt.
  - balance: Golems drain nutrition faster if near starving or below the normal soft
      crit threshold.
  - balance: Golems fall unconscious if starving.
  - balance: When a golem's nutrition hits 0, they die!
  - balance: Golems cannot get overweight, but are capped on the amount of nutrition
      they can have
  - balance: The strength of titanium's reduction to brute damage when consumed by
      a golem or rock eater has been reduced (0.7x -> 0.8x)
  - balance: Eating iron no longer heals tox or oxy for golems or rock eaters (still
      heals brute and burn)
  - balance: Golems now have a unique bodytype, making them ineligible for some surgeries
  - bugfix: You can harm people with batons that are otherwise inoperable, like an
      Abductor's baton.
  - refactor: Batonning was refactored ever so slightly. Report any oddities, particularly
      involving harmbatonning.
  - balance: Plasmamen no longer take flat 1.5x brute and burn damage
  - balance: Plasmamen are now affected by weapon demolition modifier, meaning blunt
      attacks deal more damage but slashing or piercing deal less damage
  - balance: Skeletons and Golems are also affected by weapon demolition modifier,
      as well as any mineral type mobs (of which none currently exist)

  - code_imp: Cleaned up some of fear code.
