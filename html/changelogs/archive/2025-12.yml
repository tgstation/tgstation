2025-12-02:
  ArchBTW:
  - bugfix: Click dragging something onto a tile with a decal (pool of oil/blood,
      etc)
  - code_imp: Add force_move_pulled element; replace respective code with the element

  - map: Added shutters in some of service areas on WawaStation.
  Cyberboss:
  - rscadd: Hygiene bots now extinguish when cleaning.
  Ghommie:
  - refactor: Follow-up to the crafting/material refactor from months ago. All objects
      crafted with stacks now inherit their mat composition (not necessarily the effects
      and color) by default, while previously only a few things like chair, sinks
      and toilets did. Report any object looking or behaving weirdly as a result.
  - bugfix: The material composition of ammo boxes is no longer a 1/10 of what it's
      supposed to be. It was a shitty hack to make it harder to recycle empty ammo
      boxes. Instead, they lose materials as they're emptied now.

      me

  Aliceee2ch:

  - rscadd: Added the medium sized cardboard boxes to random spawners
  - qol: You can now craft the medium sized cardboard boxes

      and reusable
  Hatterhat:
  - bugfix: Non-virtual megafauna should no longer be dropping encrypted caches when
      mulched with a crusher if their matching virtual domain was deployed.

  Jacquerel:

      location rather than physically traversing the halls of the station.

  - qol: Silent jaws of recovery is now less obvious that it's modified
  Melbert:
  - qol: If you are within a disposal bin or chute, and drop an item, the item will
      go into the bin, rather than onto the floor outside of the bin.
  TealSeer:
  - code_imp: ruin loading now logs placement coordinates
  - bugfix: fixed molotov cocktails not lighting
  Yobrocharlie:

      any possible new, quirky nit or outright problematic issue with it.
  - bugfix: Storing objects with slowdown in a backpack or belt (or any such storage)
      now properly updates your speed.
  Melbert:
  - balance: Tech storage access is no longer a "command level" access, meaning the
      HoP can give it to crewmembers that have a normal ID card. Note, secure tech
      storage still requires bridge access, which requires a silver ID card.
  - bugfix: Tie names are verified
  - bugfix: Fix mech construction

  - bugfix: The forked lizard tongue no longer makes you slur your S's if its in your
      hands or pockets.

      designations) to be a bit less monolithic'
  - bugfix: '[Catwalk] Xenobio kill room uses a passive vent'
  - bugfix: '[Catwalk] Fixes a few erroneous space tiles around sec'
  - bugfix: Bolas don't slow while in hand
  - balance: Ammo will no longer show up in the Spy loot pool until a weapon that
      uses said ammo has been claimed. Some ammo for weapons easily obtainable on
      station (shotgun shot) are not limited by this restriction. Also, there's a
      rare chance ammo will show up anyways just to keep people on their toes.
  - balance: Claiming a weapon will refresh ammo in the loot pool that has already
      been claimed or cycled out.
  - balance: Bounty rewards that no Spy claimed have a chance to re-enter the loot
      pool after a bounty refresh, rather than being lost for the remainder of the
      round.
  - balance: When higher tier Spy bounties empty their loot pools, they will attempt
      to draw from lower tier pools before defaulting to telecrystals.
  - balance: Spies no longer are rewarded with gun cases for bounties; rather just
      the gun itself
  - spellcheck: Modified the Spy antag info text
  RikuTheKiller:
  - balance: R&D console boards sourced from printing or tech storage are now locked
      by default. It's recommended to ask your respective head of department or the
      science department to complete research for you. Heads of department can remotely
      access the research network using their PDAs.
  TealSeer:
  - bugfix: fixed TRAIT_NO_UNDERWEAR not being respected in human rendering
  Tostah:

  alien3301:
  - bugfix: Captain starts with a command megaphone in their locker
  - bugfix: Executing people with guns no longer makes you hit them with the gun
  - bugfix: Trying to shoot a gun when it cant shoot doesn't make you melee with it
  - bugfix: If trying to shoot would make a click sound then executing will also make
      the sound
  dungeon_vr, KnigTheThrasher, xPokee:
  - image: The DNR ghost HUD icon has gotten a new look.
  lelandkemble:
  - bugfix: Malf AI "Destroy RCDs" power now properly destroys mech RCDs
  san7890:
  - balance: After noticing it was too easy for animals to crawl through maintenance
      by abusing the Easy-Exit sensors, Nanotrasen has replaced all unrestricted door
      sensors (like in maintenance) with a pull-down lever that should take around
      2-3 seconds to engage. It has been designed to allow the employee to actuate
      it despite any pressure differentials within an area.
  - balance: The above change does not apply to select doors in the medical section
      of the station, which will continue to use the "older" Ready-Exit system.
  - sound: In order to ensure that staff in high-traffic areas don't go bonkers due
      to this new change, sound dampeners have been installed to prevent the hydraulics
      from being heard for super long distances. However, they skimped out on the
      quality for the ones in maintenance...
2025-12-08:
  ArchBTW:
  - balance: repairbot hp 100 -> 35
  FalloutFalcon, rye-rice:
  - rscadd: Adds a small cosmetic recoil to all ballistics (with an accompanying pref

  - rscadd: Added a new set of chaplain armour based on the generic heretic robes
      unavailable since the path rework.
