  - map: Added shutters in some of service areas on WawaStation.
  Cyberboss:
  - rscadd: Hygiene bots now extinguish when cleaning.
  Ghommie:
  - refactor: Follow-up to the crafting/material refactor from months ago. All objects
      crafted with stacks now inherit their mat composition (not necessarily the effects
      and color) by default, while previously only a few things like chair, sinks
      and toilets did. Report any object looking or behaving weirdly as a result.
  - bugfix: The material composition of ammo boxes is no longer a 1/10 of what it's
      supposed to be. It was a shitty hack to make it harder to recycle empty ammo
      boxes. Instead, they lose materials as they're emptied now.

      me

  Aliceee2ch:
  - bugfix: Fixes for MetaStation fire alarms.

  - bugfix: Storing objects with slowdown in a backpack or belt (or any such storage)
      now properly updates your speed.
  Melbert:
  - balance: Tech storage access is no longer a "command level" access, meaning the
      HoP can give it to crewmembers that have a normal ID card. Note, secure tech
      storage still requires bridge access, which requires a silver ID card.
  - bugfix: Tie names are verified
  - bugfix: Fix mech construction

  - bugfix: The forked lizard tongue no longer makes you slur your S's if its in your
      hands or pockets.

  - bugfix: '[Catwalk] Fixes a few erroneous space tiles around sec'
  - bugfix: Bolas don't slow while in hand
  - balance: Ammo will no longer show up in the Spy loot pool until a weapon that
      uses said ammo has been claimed. Some ammo for weapons easily obtainable on
      station (shotgun shot) are not limited by this restriction. Also, there's a
      rare chance ammo will show up anyways just to keep people on their toes.
  - balance: Claiming a weapon will refresh ammo in the loot pool that has already
      been claimed or cycled out.
  - balance: Bounty rewards that no Spy claimed have a chance to re-enter the loot
      pool after a bounty refresh, rather than being lost for the remainder of the
      round.
  - balance: When higher tier Spy bounties empty their loot pools, they will attempt
      to draw from lower tier pools before defaulting to telecrystals.
  - balance: Spies no longer are rewarded with gun cases for bounties; rather just
      the gun itself
  - spellcheck: Modified the Spy antag info text
  RikuTheKiller:
  - balance: R&D console boards sourced from printing or tech storage are now locked
      by default. It's recommended to ask your respective head of department or the

      the sound
  dungeon_vr, KnigTheThrasher, xPokee:
  - image: The DNR ghost HUD icon has gotten a new look.
  lelandkemble:
  - bugfix: Malf AI "Destroy RCDs" power now properly destroys mech RCDs
  san7890:
  - balance: After noticing it was too easy for animals to crawl through maintenance
      by abusing the Easy-Exit sensors, Nanotrasen has replaced all unrestricted door
      sensors (like in maintenance) with a pull-down lever that should take around
      2-3 seconds to engage. It has been designed to allow the employee to actuate
      it despite any pressure differentials within an area.
  - balance: The above change does not apply to select doors in the medical section
      of the station, which will continue to use the "older" Ready-Exit system.
  - sound: In order to ensure that staff in high-traffic areas don't go bonkers due
      to this new change, sound dampeners have been installed to prevent the hydraulics
      from being heard for super long distances. However, they skimped out on the
      quality for the ones in maintenance...
2025-12-08:
  ArchBTW:

      if you try to recall a suit that's being held by another mob
  Melbert:
  - balance: Blood flow and clotting has universally been slashed by about 0.85x.
      This means blood wounds kill you slightly slower, but heal slightly slower.

      also 0.85x lower. Medicated sutures are unaffected.
  - balance: Bloody Mary's blood healing effect now scales with how drunk you are.
      Worse in low amounts, better in high amounts.

      clotting rate)
  - balance: Epoetin Alfa no longer heals liver damage.
  - balance: Epoetin Alfa regenerates 3x less blood. It's still 4x effective than

      that if you punch a meteor with enough force, it can be redirected.
  necromanceranne:
  - balance: Boxing combos are now broader and user friendly. Alternating combinations
      of buttons AND hands produces different results, but all of them good. Experiment!
  - balance: Evil boxing now has a Sucker Punch. Hit someone from behind to potentially
      knock them out cold!
  - bugfix: Punching mitts no longer mention punching rocks.

  - balance: Romerol, when applied via touch or vapor, is now guaranteed to infect
      when using >=1u. (Prior, it had a % chance of infecting equal to the amount
      of chemicals use - so 1u meant 1% chance to infect.) Other methods of applying
      Romerol are unaffected (ingesting or injecting any amount is still a guaranteed
      infection).
  MrMelbert, Zergspower:
  - qol: The world is now heavily desaturated while blind, rather than pure monochrome,
      to give players some visual stimulus

      type/version and the variant... abbreviation? Letter? One of the two.
  - spellcheck: Fixed some typos and adjusted the now-visible lore on the laser guns
      to read a little nicer, theoretically. Whether the grammar tweaks improved anything

  timothymtorres:
  - bugfix: Fix map reader ignoring valid variable names. If a variable had a number
      inside the name anywhere the map reader would ignore this value when a map was
      loaded and use the initial value instead. This was due to a faulty regex pattern
      that did not properly match variable names.
