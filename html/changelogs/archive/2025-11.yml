      to it due to their hardcoded ear protection
  - balance: How the resonant shriek changeling ability works is now slightly more
      consistent with the ear/soundbang protection, meaning it won't work well in
      a vacuum, but at least it works on simple mobs now.
  - bugfix: Everyone can now hear a changeling shriek, unless they're already deafened
      or in a vacuum.

      SSticker. TLDR is roundstart will now actually take the time it says it does,
      instead of 75% of it.
  - config: The roundstart delay config is now accurate, so you may want to decrease
      it to not overlengthen lobby time. IDK you decide.
