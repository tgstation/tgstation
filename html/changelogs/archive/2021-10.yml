      wastes for icebox, when the stations has the random spawn trait
  Mothblocks:
  - admin: You can now cancel incoming and outgoing cross comms console messages.

      spawned in CentCom. This is on by default.

      scanning!'

      gas.
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - balance: Getting hit by the tram and landing on lattice or unplated flooring (on
      the upper z-level) will now cause you to smash through it and fall to the z-level
      below at the cost of taking some extra damage. Note that floors with plating
      will still hold steady, so you can still use flooring to make getting hit by
      the tram insanely lethal, it just takes a bit more effort.

  - bugfix: The Space Hotel ruin's Staff Room and Staff Store now use distinct areas,
      and no longer have APCs fighting each other for control.

  esainane:
  - refactor: Completely restructure HFR main processes, fixing many unusual edge
      cases when the HFR was unpowered, out of fuel, interacted with other subsystems
      poorly, etc.
  - refactor: HFR equations with cryptic parameters have all been rewritten to use
      mathematically equivalent normalized equations derived from human-parseable
      parameters.
  - code_imp: The HFR now has fewer superfluous and misleading checks.
  - code_imp: HFR configuration is now much more heavily documented and generally
      readable.
  - code_imp: Many HFR defines and comments which are unused, misleading, and/or completely
      inapplicable to any public release of HFR code have been removed.
  - bugfix: The HFR now only interacts with the SSair subsystem via the side IO components.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer fail to cool if atmospherics is running slowly.
  - bugfix: The HFR's ambient sound loop will no longer fail to update to match the
      current fusion level under certain conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer fail to update its UI under certain conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer melt down at speeds largely determined by the wider
      atmospherics system.
  - bugfix: The HFR can no longer get stuck in states which heal without taking damage
      or vice versa.
  - bugfix: The HFR's healing/damage effects that depend on fusion power level now
      genuinely depend on fusion power level, rather than doing nothing but at any
      power level.
  - bugfix: The HFR no longer uses two distinct functions to fire nuclear particles,
      which effectively doubled the rate under some conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR now treats Iron Content as having appropriate units - fractional
      rather than percentage points. Accumulating Iron Content will now makes it slightly
      harder to destabilize the reaction (turn it endothermic), beware.

  - bugfix: The HFR now respects delta_time in another place, again, again, again.

  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer accumulate iron if there is no live reaction.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer passively evaporate moderator gases if there is
      no live reaction.
  - bugfix: 'The HFR, after cracking under pressure, will no longer merely leave a
      pretty decal on the affected part while becoming immune to all future cracking
      conditions, as long as nobody repaired the crack. The initial spill if highly
      pressurized is still the most dangerous, but the HFR will continue to slowly
      leak its contents even under low pressure while cracked. content: The HFR initially
      took damage at unsafe fusion levels with excess mass over 2500-1500 moles, depending
      on temperature. This was later changed to 2700-2589 moles, but in a way that
      looked like it was only meant make the thresholds a few hundred moles more tolerant.
      The range is now 2700-1800 moles.'
  - bugfix: HFR production rate is no longer multiplied by both the fuel consumption
      modifier and the gas production modifier. This means the top tier Hypernoblium/Anti-noblium
      recipe is now worth using, providing a production bonus of 3x rather than a
      penalty of x0.03. This recipe is still just as hard to operate safely.
  - bugfix: The Abandoned Zoo ruin no longer has duplicate copies of an APC, power
      cable, and rack on the same tile.

      to use composite lists.

  - expansion: 'The Mr. Deempisi Portrait plaque has been replaced with a very special
      picture frame: A small picture of one out four random things (Mr. Deempisi included)

  - spellcheck: Gives shaft miner a more accurate job description
  esainane:
  - refactor: Radiation Collectors, Tesla Coils, and Grounding Rods are now subtypes
      of a common energy_accumulator type. This centralizes logic for smoothing energy
      release; converting between Joules, Watts, and internal energy units; and ensures
      that all such accumulators display and generate power along the same smoothing
      curve.
  - bugfix: Tesla Coils no longer generate power using half the smoothing that Radiation
      Collectors used. This was due to a mistake in handling delta_time.
  - code_imp: Removed many magic numbers from power generation code.
  - qol: Tesla Coils will now display energy stored in Joules and power being produced
      in Watts, much like Radiation Collectors did.
  - qol: Grounding Rods will now display recent energy they've absorbed and the sustainable
      power that this energy could be producing. It should now be very obvious if
      you could use more Tesla Coils.
  - bugfix: Fixed supermatter lightning bolt target selection. Previously, two grounding
      rods were always* safe. Now, one grounding rod is always* safe.
  - qol: Roller Beds now come with an examine hint for how to roll them up.
  lovegreenstuff:
  - bugfix: probital now works properly on ingest. you now get mitogen again
  magatsuchi:
  - rscadd: added ability to change hologram appearance to custom character
  tralezab:

  - qol: The titlescreen is no longer described as "Effectively impervious to conventional
      methods of destruction." and only the splash screen can be interacted with
  - bugfix: you can no longer exploit the pink crossbreeding power to strip factions
      from mobs

      ninja intervention), similar to every other high risk item.
  esainane:
  - rscadd: When all else fails, dusting a Clown can alter the Supermatter's containment
      field. It might make the situation better. It might not. Who knows, HONK
  magatsuchi:
  - spellcheck: fixed a single bracket typo
  tralezab:
  - bugfix: fixes an error in department officers spawning with wallets
2021-10-19:
  Cyberboss:
  - bugfix: Prying open one of a pair of cycle-linked airlocks will now always close
      the other (if it is powered).
  - expansion: 'Arrivals, escape, and pod airlocks now restrict those without access
      from exiting directly to space. Use is unrestricted when entering the station
      or a shuttle is docked. tweak: Shuttle departures will now force exterior airlocks
      closed on both the shuttle and docking bay. The lives of your fellow crew members
      are more important than your tardiness and limbs, employee!'
  - bugfix: Fixed the numbering of escape pods in certain maps.
  Ebin-Halcyon:
  - balance: Syndicate masks are now fire + acid proof
  Ghilker:
  - qol: filters can now filter multiple gases at once

  Mothblocks:
  - rscadd: Emagging the communications console will now let you purchase dangerous
      shuttles. The Gigafactral and the Monastery were moved over (and made cheaper),
      while the Disco Inferno and Oh, Hi Daniel make a return.
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - admin: As an admin, if you start replying to a freshly submitted ticket that another
      admin is already replying to, you'll get a notice that someone already has it
      open when you get the prompt. Nice to let you know someone else is handling
      it, so you can coordinate replies better!
  That REALLY Good Soda Flavor:
  - refactor: Rolling paper will now use the customizable reagent holder component.
      This cleans up the code and expands the possibilities for using the component
      by adding support for dried items.

      on Tram.

      is examinating things through shift-click.

      from the character preference menu
  - imageadd: Added thin prescription glasses
