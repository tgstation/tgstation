  Melbert:
  - rscadd: Character Loadouts

  - refactor: Over 200 item interactions have been refactored to use a newer, easier-to-use
      system. Report any oddities with using items on other objects you may see (such
      as surgery, reagent containers like cups and spray bottles, or construction
      devices), especially using something at range (such as guns or chisels)
  - refactor: Item-On-Modsuit interactions have changed slightly. While on combat
      mode, you will attempt to "use" the item on the suit instead of inserting it
      into the suit's storage. This means being on combat mode while the suit's panel
      is open will block you from inserting items entirely via click (but other methods
      such as hotkey, clicking on the storage boxes, and mousedrop will still work).
  - refactor: The detective's scanner will now be inserted into storage items if clicked
      normally, and will scan the storage item if on combat mode
  - balance: Taking stamina damage in stamcrit has diminishing returns associated,
      meaning you cannot be infinitely stamcrit.
  Rhials:
  - bugfix: The "mopper" gimmick assistant outfit spawns with one cart instead of
      nine.

  - refactor: allowed aura healing to clot wounds shut
