  Absolucy:
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime error (albeit a harmless one) relating to wooden barricades
      being deconstructed.
  - bugfix: Added a lot more sanity checking to liquid processing, which should make
      it much harder for liquid processing to completely break.
  Gboster-0:

      powergame

  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that would cause you to be unable to lean again if you tried
      leaning while facing the wrong direction.
  - balance: Supermatter zap power generation scales with the delta time between its
      last zaps, preventing faster zapping from scaling power generation to extreme
      levels.
  - bugfix: Fixes supermatter zap rate not scaling properly. It should zap much faster
      at higher energy levels as intended.
  - qol: Changeling chemical generation scales with the world's delta time, making
      its rate independent of subsystem lag.
  - qol: Revenant essence generation scales with the world's delta time, making its
      rate independent of subsystem lag.
  - qol: Xenomorph plasma generation and resin healing scales with the world's delta
      time, making their rates independent of subsystem lag.

  - bugfix: Fix a rare issue where a turf would remain permanently "elevated" if an
      elevated object was initialized inside of a non-turf object.
  - bugfix: Holodisk recording gives the right vfx again. Bonus, the rays work with
      it now too!
