  ATHATH:
  - spellcheck: The shivering symptom has been renamed to be the "chills" symptom,
      per Cobby's request.
  - bugfix: The shivering/chills symptom now actually chills you like it says it does
      instead of heating you up. fix Safe chills and safe fever should now use an
      infectee's species's body temperature's actual cold and heat damage thresholds,
      instead of just using the default ones.
  - balance: Maxed out, unsafe chills and maxed out, unsafe fevers can now make you
      slightly colder or hotter than they could before, respectively.

  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where space carps turned grey for a moment when attacking
      something.

      to your eyes.

  LemonInTheDark, duncathan:

      you see something fail to "update" when it really should let me know yeah?

  maxymax13, /vg/station, Citadel Station:
  - imageadd: 3 new variations for wooden tiles are available (large, parquet, and
      tiled), the same way you color titanium tiles! Remember, use a screwdriver and
      not a crowbar!
  - imageadd: A new red planetary pattern design is available for arcade carpet!
  unit0016:
  - refactor: Cargo Shuttle consoles now rely a lot more on variables instead of hardcoding.

  - bugfix: The hotkey for dumping borg apparatus is now moved to Alt+Click instead
      of the nonfunctional Alt+Z. Right click for beaker apparatus spills reagent,

      it changes transfer volume.

      of by pressing an action button. This information will be given to a heretic
      or a heretic monster if they examine a heretic blade.
  - soundadd: Teleporting using a heretic blade now plays a glass shattering noise
      and produces a slightly different message (that factors in whether or not the
      teleportation attempt was successful).
  - bugfix: Teleporting using a heretic blade is now considered to be a magical teleportation
      method by the game.
  cacogen:
  - qol: RPD can destroy broken disposal pipes
