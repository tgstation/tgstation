  ATHATH:
  - spellcheck: The shivering symptom has been renamed to be the "chills" symptom,
      per Cobby's request.
  - bugfix: The shivering/chills symptom now actually chills you like it says it does
      instead of heating you up. fix Safe chills and safe fever should now use an
      infectee's species's body temperature's actual cold and heat damage thresholds,
      instead of just using the default ones.
  - balance: Maxed out, unsafe chills and maxed out, unsafe fevers can now make you
      slightly colder or hotter than they could before, respectively.
  Mothblocks:
  - bugfix: Midround events will now properly poll again.
