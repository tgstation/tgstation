      long, regardless of whether it was 1u, or 100u) There is a limit, however, and
      you can't stack infinite lube.

      will boil away instantly.

  phil235:
  - tweak: Pull and Grab are merged together. Pulling stays unchanged. Using an empty
      hand with grab intent on a mob will pull them. Using an empty hand with grab
      intent on a mob that you're already pulling will try to upgrade your grip to
      aggressive grab>neck grab>kill grab. Aggressive grabs no longer stun you, but

      you escape the grip. You can break free from the grip by trying to move or using
      the resist button.
