      the ethereal lore, and some photocopier paperwork
  EOBGames:
  - rscdel: Kilostation has went back to its home planet. It served us faithfully
      for nearly 3 and a half years. May it rest in peace.
  Helg2:
  - bugfix: You can't spam open codex cicatrix now.

  san7890:
  - refactor: Spiderlings are now basic mobs, report any complete weirdness/deviation
      from known behavior. They should be a lot more intelligent now though.
  - rscadd: AI Spiderlings are super fragile, but they're also super fast, especially
      when they get into a vent. Once they're in circulation, they could end up everywhere!
      Maybe in the armory, maybe in a locked closet in maintenance. Be sure to be
      vigilant and splat them whenever you can to save the station from a whole lotta
      heartache!
