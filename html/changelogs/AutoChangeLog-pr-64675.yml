  - expansion: "Kudzu now has a new mutation available: Cold-proofing"
  - balance: "Kudzu now stops spreading if the tile it is on is under 100K without the cold-proofing mutation."
  - balance: "Kudzu now has a severity system for mutations. Different mutations cost different severity based on their effects. There is a maximum severity which is dependent on potency, while more severe mutations also are rarer."
  - balance: "Kudzu's maximum severity is now a linear function of its potency, with it ranging from 10 to 20."
  - balance: "Kudzu's maximum spread cap per seed is now 2/3 of its old value."
  - balance: "Kudzu's spread speed is now 1/2 of its old value, but is still capped at a minimum of 1 new kudzu tile per tick."
  - balance: "Kudzu spawned by the random spacevines event's stats have been slightly buffed to replicate old behavior."
  - balance: "Venus human traps now are affected by the cold without cold-proofing."
  - balance: "Kudzu's thorns and toxicity mutations are now significantly more lethal."
  - balance: "Venus human traps now no longer have a 2 second ranged hardstun, but instead deal 85 stamina damage and a 1 second knockdown."
  - balance: "Venus human traps' damage has been lowered slightly by 20%."
  - code_imp: "Kudzu \"severity\" values now reflect severity in terms of gameplay, old severity values (used for certain mutations) are now defines instead."
  - code_imp: "Eliminates process_temperature in kudzu and moves to a flags-based system for traits"
  - bugfix: "Venus human traps' vines now get deleted after they die."
  - bugfix: "Unsuitable cold and heat damage for simplemobs don't get overrided by unsuitable atmos damage anymore."
