changes:
  - rscadd: "The Lavaland Cursed Slot Machine of Greed suddenly seems a lot more sinister..."
  - refactor: "Instead of taking clone damage from the cursed slot machine, you now get a status effect with a number of curses associated with it. There's some interesting florid language associated with the status effect as a nicety until your eventual gibbing from chasing that prize."
