  - balance: "The pro skateboard and hoverboard are now faster."
  - balance: "The improvised skateboard is a nick more unstable than the standard, so the two aren't exactly the same."
  - rscadd: "Riding a skateboard on walk intent will prevent you from crashing into things, at the cost of speed."
  - rscadd: "hoverboards now actually hovers and can be used even in zero g. There are a caveat to it: It cannot be ridden on open space gaps deeper than one level or actual space, unless there're objects that prevent falls, like lattice or catwalks."
