changes:
  - bugfix: "Signers no longer use the wrong verb when speaking directly into a radio for the first message after toggling sign language."
  - refactor: "Moved the updating of verb variables into a new method which is called earlier in living's say, which should avoid this happening for other things which updated their verbs the same way."
