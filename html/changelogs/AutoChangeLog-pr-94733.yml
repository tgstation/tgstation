changes:
  - balance: "Eldritch rusted tiles don't apply their effects to anyone who is jaunted or in vents, and don't apply negative effects to people who are flying."
  - balance: "Heretic items which apply rust (grenades and eldritch reagent) check the rust resistance level of the turf rather than always rusting it."
  - bugfix: "Rust Heretics ascending don't rust unrustable turfs, like space tiles."
