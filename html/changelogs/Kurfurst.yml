changes:
 - rscadd: New High Efficiency bulbs (2 boxes) now spawn in the Janitor's closet (more can be ordered from cargo at 2x the price for 2/3 the boxes of normal lights). These bulbs use 1/4 the energy and can keep those high stress areas like main hallway and arrivals running much, much longer.
 - imageadd: 16 new icons for lights; 1 new drink icon
 - rscadd: New reagent: "Black Food Coloring". The Bartender gets 25u of this in his closet, and it hides the contents of anything it is added to.
 - tweak: Autolathe now produces all tier 1 components.
 - tweak: Shaft Miners and Cargo Technicians no longer have access to the QM office
 - tweak: Coin boxes are now held in one hand and require only QM access instead of all access
 - tweak: Coin boxes are now size 2 and can only hold coins and vouchers.
 - tweak: Vendomats which have been fed 4 sheets of cardboard now spit out "used recharge packs" when disassembled, allowing you to save the remaining goods inside
 - tweak: Nitrogen tank moved to the bottom of O2 lockers so that Oxygen tanks are easier to grab. Gas the Vox: race war now.
