  - balance: "Changes supermatter powerloss function. It will transition to linear powerloss function at 5.88076GeV, and the linear powerloss function has been offset so that the transition between the two functions is completely smooth."
  - balance: "Changes powerloss inhibition (both CO2 and psychologist effect) to change the rate of powerloss instead of changing the rate of both functions then comparing them to which one should be used."
