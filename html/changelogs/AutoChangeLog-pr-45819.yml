changes: 
  - balance: "Explosions now cause knockdown instead of KOs, with the amount of time scaling off bomb armor. Heavy explosions still cause a ~2 second KO for follow up attacks."
  - balance: "Devastating explosions now no longer gib players with more than 50 bomb armor. This used to be more or less random depending on the amount of bomb armor."
  - code_imp: "Removed reagent explosion code that would trigger for <1 amount reactions."
