changes:
  - balance: "Golems have a whopping 0.5x modifier to brute and burn damage, but no longer have a 0.9 modifier to tox / oxy damage."
  - balance: "Golems have a new 0.6x modifier to stamina damage and stun duration, but also a new 1.2x modifier to knockdown duration."
  - balance: "Golems can no longer be defibrillated. Revival surgery is... untouched, I guess."
  - balance: "Golems can be revived by applying materials to their body. Each sheet restores some brute and burn damage, as well as some nutrition. When sufficient brute, burn, and nutrition are restored, they are revived!"
  - balance: "Golems can no longer fall into soft crit. They can still enter hard crit and die when taking sufficient damage, though."
  - balance: "When a golem is attacked with brute or burn damage, they sustain direct nutrition drain based on how much damage dealt."
  - balance: "Golems drain nutrition faster if near starving or below the normal soft crit threshold."
  - balance: "Golems fall unconscious if starving."
  - balance: "When a golem's nutrition hits 0, they die!"
  - balance: "Golems cannot get overweight, but are capped on the amount of nutrition they can have"
  - balance: "The strength of titanium's reduction to brute damage when consumed by a golem or rock eater has been reduced (0.7x -> 0.8x)"
  - balance: "Eating iron no longer heals tox or oxy for golems or rock eaters (still heals brute and burn)"
  - balance: "Golems now have a unique bodytype, making them ineligible for some surgeries"
