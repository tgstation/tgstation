  - balance: "Mosins generated via the Russian supply crate are a bit more random, weighing more heavily towards bad mosins than good mosins."
  - balance: "Buffed both the shocktrooper and special op crate. Shocktrooper now has an armored helmet and vest, and special op now has 5 mirage grenades and a chameleon belt. The survival knife in the special op crate is now a switchblade."
