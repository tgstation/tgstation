# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.
delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# There needs to be a space after the - and before the prefix. Don't use tabs anywhere in this file.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# If you're using characters such as # ' : - or the like in your changelog, surround the entire change with quotes as shown in the second example. These quotes don't show up on the changelog once it's merged and prevent errors.
# SCREW ANY OF THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
changes: 
- bugfix: "SPS will now work correctly while inside a backpack or container."
- tweak: "SPS will no longer magically detect the name of their wearer (and will no longer report their wearer as 'unknown' if their face melts off), instead now broadcast their GPS tag. They also now broadcast precise coordinates as well as the general area."
