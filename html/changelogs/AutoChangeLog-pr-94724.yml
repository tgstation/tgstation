changes:
  - rscadd: "You can now also load stunprods into ballistas, make sure you turn them on first though"
  - balance: "The mounted ballista's damage, wound chance, and armour penetration is now dependent on what kind of spear is loaded into it, and is generally a bit lower"
  - balance: "Mounted guns are less accurate when not wrenched down"
  - bugfix: "Cancelling reloading a ballista now cancels the reload rather than completing it."
  - bugfix: "You can pick up the exact same spear you fired out of a ballista, rather than a totally new generic spear"
  - bugfix: "It is possible to damage and destroy mounted guns with weapons"
  - code_imp: "Reworked mounted guns to duplicate less code, please report any deviant behaviour"
