  - rscadd: "Added credit holochips, a form of semi-physical currency to use in transactions. They can be generated by id cards by drawing from bank accounts and can be used to make payments."
  - rscadd: "There is no limit to the amount of credits that can be stored on a holochip, but being holograms they are vulnerable to electromagnetic pulses, and may disappear if exposed to one!"
  - rscadd: "Holochips can be split with alt-click, and can be merged by clicking on another holochip."
