changes:
  - refactor: "Refactored how deafness is tracked. Please report any weird interactions with sounds, like messages or sfx being missing."
  - bugfix: "Lacking ears and being in hard crit now consistently treats you as \"being deaf\". This affects a few minor interactions like empath, the jukebox, and sleeping."
