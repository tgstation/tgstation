      phylactery well, for he is immortal!

      phylactery item before they can ressurect to it. The more a lich is slain the

      crew is to catch him during a vunerable moment.

      is used for all the remaining calculations instead of Armour (Eg: 80 Melee -

  - rscadd: The Sleeping Carp clan has made its presence known on Space Station 13.

      the AI from becoming too omnipresent.'
  phil235:
  - tweak: Space drug overdose no longer cause brute/brain damage but you hallucinate

      that lizards use: ears and tails. Right now only admins can edit these.'
  - rscadd: Updated the system that checks for which jobs your character qualifies
      to be species-dependant. At this moment you won't notice any differences, but
      in the future coders can use this to be more specific about which jobs a species
      is allowed in under which circumstances.
