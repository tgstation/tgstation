  - rscadd: You can now select a nearby area to expand when using a blueprint instead
      of making a new area.
  - rscadd: New shuttle areas can be created using blueprints. This is currently not
      useful but will be used later for shuttle construction.
  - tweak: Blueprints can modify existing areas on station.
  - admin: Blueprint functionality has been added to the debug tab as a verb.
2017-11-14:

      cultists in highpop.
  - tweak: Damage examinations now include a "moderate" classification. Before minor

  Skylar Lineman, your local R&D moonlighter:
  - rscadd: Research has been completely overhauled into the techweb system! No more
      levels, the station now unlocks research "nodes" with research points passively
      generated when there is atleast one research server properly cooled, powered,
      and online.
  - rscadd: R&D lab has been replaced by the departmental lathe system on the three
      major maps. Each department gets a lathe and possibly a circuit imprinter that
      only have designs assigned by that department.
  - rscadd: The ore redemption machine has been moved into cargo bay on maps with
      decentralized research to prevent the hallways from becoming a free for all.
      Honk!
  - balance: You shouldn't expect balance as this is the initial merge. Please put
      all feedback and concerns on the forum so we can revise the system over the
      days, weeks, and months, to make this enjoyable for everyone. Heavily wanted
      are ideas of how to add more ways of generating points.
  - balance: You can get techweb points by setting off bombs with an active science
      doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above
      maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you
      can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically
      scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.
  SpaceManiac:
  - bugfix: HUDs from mechs and helmets no longer conflict with HUD glasses and no
      longer inappropriately remove implanted HUDs.
  - code_imp: Chasm code has been refactored to be more sane.
  - bugfix: Building lattices over chasms no longer sometimes deletes the chasm.

      balancing in symptoms.
  - rscadd: Starlight Condensation heals toxin damage if you're in space using starlight
      as a catalyst. Being up to two tiles away also works, as long as you can still
      see it, but slower.
  - rscadd: Toxolysis (level 7) rapidly cleanses all chemicals from the body, with
      no exception.
  - rscadd: 'Cellular Molding heals brute damage depending on your body temperature:
      the higher the temperature, the faster the healing. Requires above-average temperature
      to activate, and the speed heavily increases while on fire.'
  - rscadd: Regenerative Coma (level 8) causes the virus to send you into a deep coma
      when you are heavily damaged (>70 brute+burn damage). While you are unconscious,
      either from the virus or from other sources, the virus will heal both brute

      from the poisoning effects of plasma.
  - rscadd: Radioactive Resonance gives a mild constant brute and burn healing while
      irradiated. The healing becomes more intense if you reach higher levels of radiation,
      but is still less than the alternatives.
  - rscadd: Metabolic Boost (level 7) doubles the rate at which you process chemicals,
      good and bad, but also increases hunger tenfold.
  kevinz000:
  - bugfix: Cryo cells can now be properly rotated with a wrench.
  ninjanomnom:
  - rscadd: 'You can now make a new tasty traditional treat: butterdogs. Watch out,
      they''re slippery.'
2017-11-28:
  ACCount:
  - rscdel: '"Machine prototype" is removed from the game.'

  Naksu:
  - code_imp: Cleans up some loc assignments
  Robustin:

  - balance: Clockwork magicks will now prevent Bags of Holding from being combined
      on Reebe.

  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Light fixtures now turn an ominous, dim red color when they lose power,
      and draw from an internal power cell to maintain it until either the cell dies
      (usually after 10 minutes) or power is restored.
  - rscadd: You can override emergency light functionality from an APC. You can also
      click on individual lights as a cyborg or AI to override them individually.

      burn!
  MrPerson & ninjanomnom:
  - refactor: Completely changed how keyboard input is read.
  - rscadd: Holding two directions at the same time will now move you diagonally.
      This works with the arrow keys, wasd, and the numpad.

  - bugfix: You can use control to turn using wasd and the numpad instead of just
      the arrow keys.
  - rscdel: 'Some old non-hotkey mode behaviors, especially in relation to chatbox
      interaction, can''t be kept with the new system. Of key note: You can''t type
      while walking. This is due to limitations of byond and the work necessary to
      overcome it is better done as another overhaul allowing custom controls.'
  Robustin:
  - rscdel: Reverted changes in 3d sound system that tripled the distance that sound
      would carry.
  SpaceManiac:
  - spellcheck: Energy values are now measured in joules. What was previously 1 unit
      is now 1 kJ.
  - bugfix: Syndicate uplink implants now work again.

  XDTM:
  - rscadd: 'Brain damage has been completely reworked! remove: Brain damage now no
      longer simply makes you dumb. Although most of its effects have been shifted
      into a brain trauma.'
  - rscadd: Every time you take brain damage, there's a chance you'll suffer a brain
      trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and
      special.
  - rscadd: Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately
      annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time.
  - rscadd: Severe brain traumas are much rarer and require extensive brain damage
      before you have a chance to get them; they are usually very debilitating. Unlike
      mild traumas, they require surgery to cure. A new surgery procedure has been
      added for this, the aptly named Brain Surgery. It can also heal minor traumas.
  - rscadd: 'Special brain traumas are rarely gained in place of Severe traumas: they
      are either complex or beneficial. However, they are also even easier to cure
      than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping
      a mild trauma along with it.'
  - rscadd: Mobs can only naturally have one mild trauma and one severe or special
      trauma.
  - balance: Brain damage will now kill and ruin the brain if it goes above 200. If
      it somehow goes above 400, the brain will melt and be destroyed completely.
  - balance: Many brain-damaging effects have been given a damage cap, making them
      non-lethal.
  - rscdel: The Unintelligible mutation has been removed and made into a brain trauma.
  - rscdel: Brain damage no longer makes using machines a living hell.
  - rscadd: Abductors give minor traumas to people they experiment on.

      ghosts as the Eminence from the eminence spire structure on Reebe.
  - rscadd: The Eminence is incorporeal and invisible, and directs the entire cult.
      Anything they say is heard over the Hierophant network, and they can issue commands
      by middle-clicking themselves or different turfs.
  - rscadd: The Eminence also has a single-use mass recall that warps all servants
      to the Ark chamber.
  - rscadd: Added traps, triggers, and brass filaments to link them. They can all
      be constructed from brass sheets, and do different things and trigger in different
      ways. Current traps include the brass skewer and steam vent, and triggers include
      the pressure sensor, lever, and repeater.

      taking an extra second less.

      The title screen images and the title screen area on the Centcom z-level will
      have to be updated if the default view range is changed.
