  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Added Choco-Coins, available in Getmore's vending machines, or can be
      made with one chocolate bar and 5 milk at a microwave.
  - imageadd: Choco-Coin sprites courtesy of a generous Anon in the general.
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: Slimes now keep their names when they evolve or split.
  - rscdel: Slimes are no longer named baby or adult due to the above. If you can't
      tell the difference you can examine the slime instead.
  N3X15:
  - rscadd: Added blattogenesis effect to viruses.
2015-12-29:
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added light tile remotes - devices that can remotely change colour and
      state of light tiles. They're compactible with assemblies and assembly frames,
      and can be built by protolathes.
  - rscadd: Up to five assemblies can be connected to the atmos automation console.
      Connected assemblies can be activated using the Assembly - Pulse command.
2015-12-30:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Added tech levels to many common items, so that they can be scanned with
      the Device Analyser. Notorious additions are PDA cartridges, Laser Tag equipment,
      Hookshots, Straightjacket/Muzzle/Blindfold, Pill collectors, Hailers, Modkits,
      and Shoulder holsters.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - experiment: Added meteor types. All sorts of fun new meteors might spawn depending
      on wave type, with special effects
  - bugfix: Fix meteor spawning proc causing some meteors to hit Z-level transition,
      and causing small waves to be 60 % smaller than intended
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: People who are turned into statues and shattered are now gibbed instead
      of turned to dust.
  TheEliminator16:
  - rscadd: Added a new child of bear called "Skrite". Adminbus only mob that hits
      like a bear and is twice as tough as one. Skrites move considerably slower than
      bears, on account of having only one leg, but make up for it with a toxic projectile
      attack.
  - imageadd: Added skrite sprites to animal.dmi
  - imageadd: Added skrite sprites to animal.dmi (used the correct animal.dmi this
      time, sorry niggly, I fucked your pudding)
  Unid:
  - tweak: When reading a newscaster, clicking on a photo will show you its description
2015-12-31:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: Borers now transfer when their host is transformed. Depending on the new
      mob they become, you might be dropped. For admin transformations you always
      get dropped.
  - tweak: Mobs with borers in them are no longer immune to the staff of change.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added superglue. It can be applied to any item to make it unable to be
      dropped. Undroppable items can't be put in machines, thrown or dropped. However,
      they can still be eaten, disassembled or (in case of stacks) separated.
  - rscadd: Clown and mime traitors may purchase a bottle of superglue (one time use)
      for 3 telecrystals.
2016-01-01:
  DeadPoolJ:
  - rscadd: Made a new admin verb, Send Fax, which lets admins send a fax without
      having to reply to one first.
  - rscadd: Made faxes and prayers show up in the special window if admins have it
      enabled.)
  Dylanstrategie:
  - bugfix: Chemistry has been broken for nineteen days, so badly that you couldn't
      splash reagents on people, objects or turfs. Nineteen fucking days, and it took
      Sarah fucking Johnson to come back from the dead to report it
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Subjugation no longer lasts for upwards of 10 minutes. It now lasts 3 minutes
      per cast.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Animals can only be butchered on help intent now.
2016-01-02:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Combat messages (X has attacked Y with Z) will now show up in a bigger
      font for the player that was hit. For now this only applies to most melee attacks,
      if you come across a message that you feel should be made bigger for the affected
      player, don't hesitate to make an in-game report.
  - tweak: External blood loss has been slowed by 25%, though you'll still lose roughly
      the same amount of blood.
  - rscadd: Lying down will reduce the amount of blood you lose from external bleeding
      by 30% (This goes a longer way than it sounds). If you can't stop the bleeding,
      your best bet is to lie down and call for help or have someone drag you.
  - tweak: Tweaked low blood level warnings to give a little of a warning transition
      between "mostly fine" and "going into shock".
  - tweak: Slightly tweaked the effect of low blood levels, previously medium blood
      loss would be deadlier than heavy blood loss. It will still kill you pretty
      dead.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - rscadd: Singularity Beacons now have an internal battery. It will last one minute,
      which allows you to either set up a quick beacon without wires, or continue
      dragging when the Singularity knocks out the powernet
  - rscadd: The Singularity Beacon now glows red when on. This means it will be far
      less concealable in darkness, and shouldn't be adjacent to a wall (due to the
      way lighting works)
  - tweak: Singularity Beacons now needs to be wrenched down instead of screwed down.
      Cable is connected on hand interaction (interact again to turn on and off) and
      disconnected by wrenching or unwrenching
  - tweak: Singularity Beacons now need 500 W/s to run, and actually drain that amount
      from the grid
2016-01-03:
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: Added a new artifact which can be found through xenoarcheology
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Double Agents will no longer be given the die a glorious death objective.
      Instead they have a chance to get the escape alone objective.
  Wizardcrying:
  - tweak: Viruses no longer mutate their effects when their host catches some radiation.
      This change actually dates back to Nov. 10, 2015, but it was never added to
      the changelog until now.
2016-01-04:
  Duny:
  - rscadd: Added a borer egg and a plasma canister to xenobiology. Two portable air
      scrubbers have also been added in xenobiology maintenance.
  - bugfix: Fixed glass doors on the derelict not being dense.
  - bugfix: Fixed solar APCs not charging.
  - rscadd: Added a coin press to the asteroid.
  - tweak: Modified the morgue's layout, more trays and less empty space.
  - tweak: Fixed up a bit the walls and rwalls around science to be more nanotrasen-approved.
  - rscadd: Added a light switch to hydrophonics.
  - bugfix: Fixed Mechanics Workshop vent not being connected to anything.
  - tweak: Added a few additional lights in science to make the hallway less spooky
      when one breaks.
  - bugfix: Attached the floating camera in xenobio to the wall.
  - rscadd: Added two cyborg analyzers to robotics.
  - rscadd: Added plant clippers in xenobotany.
  - rscadd: Added compressed matter cartridges in the bar storage, and replaced the
      shotgun with a double-barreled model.
  - tweak: Tweaked the starting charge of the SMES cells again. Might or might not
      be adequate since I still can't use SMES cells or APCs or anything else so I
      can't test it properly.
  Dylanstrategie:
  - tweak: Change Syndicate ammo box to contain a loaded speedloader, instead of an
      empty speedloader and an ammo box (with as many bullets)
2016-01-05:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Unsnowflaked Godblunts. This means that they will now have exactly the
      same reagents the plant had, nothing more.
  - bugfix: Fixed botany nonsense that could result in negative mols of a gas.
  - bugfix: Hopefully fixed the Reverse Engine and General Fabricator bugging out
      with any items that could be created in the Protolathe. There's a chance I've
      fucked this up, so if you notice any subsequent bugs please don't hesitate to
      use the in-game bug reporter.
  PJB3005:
  - experimental: 'Made map voting weight-based: if box got 75% of the votes, meta
      10% and deff 15%, those chances will be used to pick the map.'
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Light tiles now emit colored light
  - bugfix: Fixed newscasters eating photos
2016-01-06:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now read books by examining them when close enough. Ghosts
      can now also click a bookcase to read the books that are inside (without removing
      them from the bookcase).
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a reagent container (i.e. beaker) while it's in your inventory
      will now directly bring up the \"Set transfer amount\" menu.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a Chemistry Dispenser will now directly eject it's beaker,
      if any.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a portable scrubber or portable pump will now eject their
      held tank, without having to open their menu.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a washing machine will now start it. Likewise for Centrifuges.
  - rscadd: Janicarts have now gained a \"Remove Trash Bag\" verb. Alt-clicking a
      Janicart will directly remove it's trash bag. Clicking a Janicart while you're
      riding it will no longer bring up a popup asking what you want to do, it will
      instead always make you stop riding it. If you want to remove the trash bag
      while riding it, use the verb or alt-click.
  - experiment: If you can think of any other alt-click shortcuts that you'd like
      to see in the game, please don't hesitate to write a letter, stamp it, and mail
      it to my house, but don't make a feature request or people other than me will
      have to read it, which gets them mad cranky.
2016-01-07:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: If a fruit naturally produces than 100 units of a chemical, it will now
      try to fraction the chemicals into 100 units, rather than discard the overflow.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to dilute hydroponics tray toxicity by using water.
  - bugfix: Fixed General Fabricator not working with certain items (again), probably
      fixes General Fabricator trying to use acid when making circuitboards.
2016-01-09:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Diona pods now start with 35 durability. This means that they won't immediately
      die as soon as the lights are turned off or the tray gets weeds or something
      similar. This also means that, due to popular vote, Diona seeds are easily attainable
      by using plant clippers.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Adds the ability for ghosts to jump into borers with no ckey assigned.
      Just click on them as a ghost to check, but you do need to not have the spawnban
      from ghosting
2016-01-10:
  ArthurDentist:
  - rscadd: Added Eucharist Wafers which can be made in the microwave with 5 holy
      water and 5 flour. Seven also exist in the Chaplain's Vendor.

  - tweak: Boxing gloves now reduce dexterity, just like knuckledusters
  - tweak: Boxing gloves now double the chance to stun your enemy in unarmed combat
  - tweak: Graffiti may now be drawn on walls (although slightly slower).
  - tweak: Grass, planks, stacks produced from crafting or from the biogenerator will
      now automatically stack with each other (so harvesting from a tray with glass
      yields one stack with 5 grass tiles)
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Taxi docks are now U-shaped and have two entrances each.
  - tweak: Slightly enlarged cargo bay QM office, custodial closet, dorms, hydroponics,
      kitchen, bar, tool storage, atmos, pod bay, brig, toxins, xenobio, xenobotany,
      and head of staff offices.
  - rscadd: Added jetpacks in EVA, engi/cargo EVA, and engineering.
  - rscadd: Added borer egg, plasma canister, and injector to xenobio.
  - rscadd: Added second pair of airlocks to mining dock, to prevent depressurization.
  - rscadd: Added intercom next to bhangmeter.
  - tweak: Flipped the courtroom horizontally to make it more accessible to the public.
  - rscadd: Added solid plasma to engineering for PACMAN use.
  - tweak: Redesigned theater backroom as one large room.

      to control medbay's lights.
  - bugfix: Removed duplicate disposal chute from R&D.
  - rscadd: Added botany machines to xenobotany.
  - rscadd: Added external airlocks to maint near genetics and sec/sci bridge.
  - bugfix: Fixed areas and incorrect windows in vox outpost.
  - spellcheck: Fixed typos on two security camera names.
2016-01-14:
  Pomf123:
  - bugfix: Fixed station vox not having sol common during heist and fixed heist vox
      having sol common.
2016-01-17:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed stackable items (metal rods, floortiles etc) only giving one item's
      worth of materials when recycled at an Autolathe, regardless of how many items
      there were in the stack. Also fixes metal rods and possibly more items having
      the same bug or not working at all in the Recycler. Given that this had been
      broken for over half a year with seemingly no reports, I'm obliged to say once
      again that if you notice anything weird with this fix, you should make an in-game
      bug report.
2016-01-18:
  Kurfurst:
  - bugfix: Extinguishers once again properly calm the heart of a rabid slime
2016-01-19:
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Enlarged engineering just a little.
  - rscadd: Added a singularity telescreen outside engine room.
  - tweak: Adjusted engine room so that rad collectors are closer to singularity generator.
  - bugfix: fixed a floating fire extinguisher in engineering.
  - tweak: Removed the table between kitchen and botany so that chefs and botanists
      can get between departments.
  - rscadd: Added two trays to hydroponics.
  - tweak: Enlarged xenobio cells to 2x3.
  - tweak: Adjusted lights in several areas which were too dim.
2016-01-22:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed nested storage items (e.g. a box inside a backpack) closing their
      inventory when you move, even if you were holding the parent storage item.
  - bugfix: Fixed not being able to use screwdrivers as ghetto surgery tools.
  - tweak: Added an error message when trying to use surgery to fix a bone fracture
      in a very damaged limb. This is to prevent the \"bone explodes immediately after
      being mended\" syndrome.
  - tweak: Will no longer place items on operating tables, which was really annoying
      because it would end up in accidentally dropping your surgery tools under the
      patient. If you really want to place an item on top of the operating table for
      some reason, you can throw it on top instead.
2016-01-23:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed trays not picking up items. Fixed trays not removing their items
      when dropped or thrown. Fixed trays picking up items bigger than w_class = 3.
      Also fixed trays picking up trays. Also fixed a tray-related gamebreaking exploit
      that allowed you to permanently delete the nukedisk. Also fixed a tray-related
      gamebreaking exploit that allowed you to put any item inside a backpack, including
      other backpacks, and load a backpack past it's maximum storage slots. These
      things were really broken, weren't they?

  - wip: The following changes apply to Metaclub.
  - rscdel: Removed the hot drinks machine from permabrig.
  - rscadd: Added a newscaster to tcomms control room, for easy AI access.

  - tweak: Moved the launch room intercom closer to the bhangmeter.
  - rscdel: Removed the sleeper blocking the infirmary door on the escape pod docking
      shuttle.
  - tweak: Rearranged the emergency shuttle infirmary to remove the console-less sleeper.
  - tweak: Un-reinforced the tables in toxins.
  - tweak: Widened xenobio.

      some live testing so please give feedback at github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/7813
      if you end up in a Mixed cult round.
  - bugfix: Fixed new blood splatters not properly replicating the DNA of other blood
      splatters on their same turfs unless the round is cult.
  TheEliminator16:
  - bugfix: Made brown gloves properly use the on mob sprite.

2016-01-25:
  DrCelt:
  - experiment: SUMMARY
  - rscadd: Heat transfer Rehaul
  - rscadd: Hypothermia added
  - rscadd: changes to things that cause cold damage
  - rscadd: space blankets
  - rscadd: ghetto space suits with space blankets
  - rscadd: thermal homeostasis regulator that when emagged becomes the mancrowave
  - tweak: changes to cryo
  - experiment: INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HEAT TRANSFER
  - tweak: removes useless variables heat_protection & cold_protection as these were
      in 99% of circumstances the exact same as body_parts_covered
  - rscadd: added a new variable, heat_conductivity to all items, determining how
      fast they conduct heat away from you
  - rscadd: added new procs to humans, sweat() & burn_calories() - Now whenever you
      use up nutriment, you generate heat, but can also expend nutriment to decrease
      heat.
  - rscadd: refactored how heat transfer away from humans worked ( see above)
  - experiment: INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HYPOTHERMIA
  - rscadd: added Mild Hypothermia (between 32 and 35C) - this results in shivering,
      minor slowdown and messages informing the player that they are cold.
  - rscadd: added Moderate hypothermia (between 28 and 32C) - Shivering stops, slowdown
      increases, may slur/stutter words, chance of dropping items in hand and collapsing
      temporarily, as well as a 25% chance of forgetting how to use machines like
      when braindamaged
  - rscadd: added severe hypothermia (24 to 28C), shivering stops, player is unconcious,
      pulse decreases to 30BPM and has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, which
      decreases over time as you are still breathing.
  - rscadd: added profound hypothermia (less than 24C), pulse stops, player has a
      25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, does not decrease over time as they are
      not breathing.
  - tweak: CHANGES THINGS WHICH CAUSE COLD DAMAGE, including but not limited to coldingtons,
      cryokinesis, showers, goliaths, temperature gun, and chemicals which chill people.
      Foam fire extinguishers are not affected.
  - experiment: THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR
  - experiment: Please use this when taking someone out of cryo
  - tweak: When a person is dragged in, it will automatically begin stabilising, there
      is no need for more buttons to be pressed
  - tweak: Takes 5 seconds to heat/cool someone to 37C, which works out as quicker
      than shaking someone up.
  - rscadd: Can be emagged to allow for three extra settings - this process is extremely
      visible, and there is a different sprite for when an emagged function is used
  - rscadd: Can reenable security features to quickly unemag the device and Can bring
      the device to an emergency stop.
  - experiment: CHANGES TO CRYO
  - tweak: Cryo now releases someone at 23C instead of -12C (or 25C if they manually
      eject)
  - experiment: PLEASE USE THE THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR AFTER TAKING PEOPLE OUT
      OF CRYO
  - tweak: Manual eject time brought down from 2 minutes to 30 seconds to make it
      time-neutral
  - tweak: This means that, as the person is ejected below profound hypothermia, they
      will not breathe until they heat up a wee bit further. This is a positive change,
      as vox & plasmamen will no longer die from toxin damage/fire immediately after
      leaving cryo.
  - rscadd: People inside a cryo cell do not suffer from hypothermia until leaving.
2016-01-26:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Admins can now specify which modes they want in Mixed (among the modes
      allowed in Mixed)
  - imageadd: Revamped fireplaces.
  - imageadd: Paper bins have a new default sprite. Their sprite is now different
      whether there's a blank paper, a written paper, or a cult talisman on top.
  - rscadd: You can now also read the top paper or identify which talisman (if you're
      a cultist) is on top simply by examining the paper bin.
  Zth:
  - bugfix: Fixed flatpacks dissapearing when unstacking them.
2016-01-28:

      and it were to be destroyed in some manner
2016-02-02:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Better solution to the 'bone explodes immediately after being mended' syndrome.
      You will now once again be able to fix bones no matter the damage level of the
      limb. If the limb is so damaged that it would immediately break again after
      setting the bone, it will now heal to just under bone fracture levels. Note
      that this effectively lets you heal brute damage on dead people.
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Added a bunch of wiki links for every antag roles in the Character Setup
      window. Also separated actual antag roles from non-antag special roles.
  Sood:

  - rscadd: Added a new human-unique language, Sol Common. (Doesn't actually look
      a thing like Esperanto but that's what it's based off of)

      strip people, toggle your mask, and maybe use a few other verbs while on a vehicle
      or buckled to a chair.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Sol Common is now blue, and uses its old syllables (Mandarin+English)

      syllables Sol originally used.
  - bugfix: Cryo no longer gives cold burns.
  Unid:
  - bugfix: Hypnotise costs 10 blood (instead of 0), bat form costs 30 blood (instead
      of 0), chiroptean screech costs 30 blood (instead of 10), shadowstep costs 20
      blood (instead of 0)
2016-02-04:
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Merged flags_inv and body_parts_covered
  - bugfix: Fixed clothing being contaminated undesirably
  - bugfix: Fixes a bunch of unreported bugs due to the nature of the PR varying from
      the HoP jacket the riot suit and the stallhelm. If there is a bug where a sprite
      was overriding where it should not have this SHOULD fix that
  - experimental: This SHOULD also prevent that type of bug ever happening again.
      Please bugreport if you notice any sprite errors
  - rscadd: Adds is_slot_hidden proc
  - tweak: Splits head thermal conductivity into three parts
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where agent gas masks would conceal identities when their

  9600bauds:
  - tweak: When making bottles at a Chemmaster, you will now be prompted to input
      how many bottles you want to make before being prompted to name the bottles.
      This is to keep consistency with making pills (prevent bottles named '3'), and
      also allows the bottles to be automatically named after many units of chemicals
      they contain.
  - rscadd: You can now alt-click Chemmasters and All-in-One Grinders to eject their
      beaker, if they have one loaded.
2016-02-08:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed Diona nymphs talking in monkey language, rather than in rootspeak.
  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Adds a noir genetics block which the detective starts roundstart with
      if he has selected the "Gumshoe" alternate title. This block turns the client
      black and white except for blood.

  - tweak: Facehuggers now have a health var. Currently this is only affected by bullets.
      They will die in most of the ways they died before.
  - rscadd: Facehuggers will now acquire targets and walk to them, and hug them when
      they're close enough.
2016-02-09:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Slightly buffed the surgery speed bonuses of advanced surgery tools (laser
      scalpels, surgical incision manager).
  - tweak: Fix-o-Vein, bone gel, and bone setters now have the same size as other
      surgery tools, meaning they now fit in pockets and boxes.
  - tweak: Circular saws and surgical drills no longer fit in pockets or boxes.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Masks do not protect against facehuggers. Wear a face-covering helmet such
      as a RIG helmet or bio hood.
  - experiment: Helmets have a 50% chance to be removed on facehugger attacks. This
      is a temporary balance change, but may stay if it this turns out to be enough.
  - bugfix: Facehugger toys will not forcefully remove headgear or path on their own.
      They will still leap at you if you walk next to them though.
  - bugfix: Sterile/non-real facehuggers will not protect against virile or real facehuggers.

  DrCelt:
  - rscadd: Had to hand in my Pull Request to the Chief - He'd always had it out for
      me, and the code ain't ever been in my favour, not since the war anyway. I looked
      it all over once more, tryin' to get to the bottom of this mystery, but it ain't
      easy finding bugs in some downtrodden code like this.I thought of that paddy
      dame that showed up in my office last week, asking for me to help her. Said
      someone called 'Gene Ettics' went AWOL. I told her I'd do what I could, and
      that's why I'm here. I opened up my flask of brandy and took a sip. It was going
      to be a long night. Chief or no chief, I'm getting to the bottom of this case.
  - rscadd: Re-adds the Noir Block.
  Pomf123:
  - bugfix: Fixed sechuds seeing through masks.
  TheEliminator16:
  - rscadd: Added the "Hostile Infestation" event. Similar to the normal infestation
      event, though this time with hostile mobs
  - rscadd: Added "Silent Meteors" event. Adminbus only, not random, allows for admins
      to send meteors without a command report. I'm sure this will never be abused,
      ever.
  - rscadd: Added "Organic Debris Field" event. Similar to meteors except instead
      of killing everyone, it splatters the outside of the station with gore, body
      parts, organs, exploding corpses...
  - rscadd: Added "Mass Drunkenness" event. Causes everyone on the station to be drunk
      for less than a minute.
  - rscadd: Added "Mass Hallucination", "Silent Meteors", "Hostile Infestation", "Organic
      Debris Field", and "Mass Drunkenness" events to admin secrets panel. Any admin
      with +FUN can access them.
  - rscadd: Made "Hostile Infestation", "Organic Debris Field", and "Mass Drunkenness"
      events possible to occur randomly.
  - rscadd: Added necromorphs.
  - rscadd: Added "spider queen", a large version of the nurse spider with a projectile
      attack that creates web where it lands and a lot of health.
2016-02-13:
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Adds a space-worthy exploration suit only for greys. Sprites courtesy
      of Niggly.
  - rscadd: Adds vox, plasmaman, and grey spacesuit crates to cargo, so plasmamen
      hit by polyacid can finally get a replacement helmet and such.
  xpcybic:
  - wip: The following changes apply to Taxistation.
  - tweak: Redesigned almost all of medbay with the goal of reducing cramp and improving
      workflow between departments. Adds a lobby, moves sleepers/cryo to center, moves
      paramedic to left, moves patient rooms to upper-left, adds a medical storage
      room, enlarges genetics, virology, and CMO.
  - tweak: Changed morgue airlock to require either morgue or paramedic access.
  - tweak: Expanded the small room in medsci maint into an unfinished office.
  - bugfix: Fixed vent and scrubber piping in CE office.

      shuttle from docking at it.
  - tweak: Adjusted derelict arrivals so that the salvage shuttle can dock at it.
2016-02-14:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed a very bizzare bug that could result in humans (especially lings,
      monkeymen, and head transplanted players) having TWO different blood types,
      each one of them only used for certain things.
  - bugfix: Monkeymen will now properly have randomized blood types.
  - rscdel: Players will now have randomized blood types as well. Random blood types
      follow a weighted distribution. Hopefully this will save Medbay from a lot of
      headaches.
  - experiment: 'The blood type distribution is as follows: 36% O+, 28% A+, 20% B+,
      5% AB+, 4% O-, 3% A-, 1% B-, 1% AB-. This is the same distribution Monkeymen
      were supposed to have, although a bug prevented it from working properly.'
  - rscadd: Your blood type is now added to your character notes when you spawn, in
      case you lose your ID (use the 'notes' verb, IC tab). You can check on other
      people's blood type by examining their ID or using the Medical Records database.
  - rscadd: Added a 'Wake-Up Cycle' option to Sleepers, which will try to wake up
      the occupant. This is intended to work as an alternative to the Mancrowave.
      Alt-clicking a Sleeper while an occupant is inside will automatically start
      this cycle.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Paralysis Summary timer not working properly on Sleepers (this
      will give you an approximation of how long the occupant's paralysis/sleep would
      last if left alone).
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Added the blunderbuss.
  - rscadd: Added the tomahawk.
  - rscadd: Added the pipe tomahawk.

  - tweak: Wizards now spawn with all organic limbs and internal organs.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added a new, disorienting hallucination effect.
2016-02-15:
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Baby carps now attack unconscious mobs. When they attack living mobs enough
      times, they grow up.
  - rscadd: Baby carps can be fed by attacking them with meat. Feeding them has a
      slight chance of making them your friend, and will eventually cause them to
      grow up.
  - rscadd: Baby animals now consider their mother's friends their friends. This applies
      to space carps, too
2016-02-16:
  JoeMother0:
  - imageadd: The Gumshoe detective alt title now starts with his own original suit
      and coat
2016-02-17:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: Cryo cells now pop you out at a safe temperature once again, though just
      cold enough to give you the jitters for a few seconds. However, it takes 4 seconds
      to eject somebody from a Cryo cell. Essentially, the Mancrowave's body heat
      regulation functionality was directly implemented into Cryo.
  - rscadd: Cryo cells now also give a short period of grace to non-oxygen-breathing
      races after being ejected from Cryo, in which they won't breathe (and Plasmamen
      won't combust) so that they may be given internals safely. This is to replace
      the effects of post-cryo Hypothermia, which made people not breathe.
2016-02-19:
  CptWad:
  - rscadd: PBJ's code that makes it so now supermatters not on your z-level exploding

  - rscadd: Ported over metaclubs Centcomm, so ERT and Deathsquad can exist and more
      room for bus
  - rscadd: Added the Vox Skipjack from box, so now Vox Raiders can happen on Defficiency
  - rscadd: Added the salvage shuttle to Z level 6, but as Defficiency is defficient
      of an aux-docking port, it cant dock to the station properly.
  - rscadd: Fixed a piping error in xenobiology, gave it and the research corridor
      some more vents considering the size
  - rscadd: Expanded the xenobotany area on the research outpost. It now also has
      gas-controlled trays (just need to wrench them down)
  - rscadd: Added an autolathe to R&D
  - rscadd: Fixed a few area mishaps (Area in front of the HoPs office that had no
      defined area, areas in the SME room that werent correct)
  - rscadd: Relocated the Mancrowave in medical to somewhere a bit more sensible,
      removed the Sec outpost from medical as it was unused.
  - rscadd: Removed stools from the brig as they no longer counted as chairs, but
      weapons.
  - rscadd: Added a vox outpost to the asteroid z-level, a bit off the beaten track
  SonixApache:
  - imageadd: Ian now wears his engineering RIG properly. He can also wear security
      vests and a SWAT helmet.
  Sood:
  - experiment: 'Deus Ex Update:'
  - tweak: (Deus Ex Update hijacked by Sood from N3X15)
  - rscadd: Lungs are now fully modular and actually process gas for humans.  Lungs
      must be compatible with a species or they will die of suffocation.
  - rscadd: Vox and Plasmamen have their own lungs.
  - rscadd: Most species currently exhale CO<sub>2</sub>.  Vox may be tweaked later
      to exhale N<sub>2</sub>O. Plasmamen exhale oxygen, though.
  - rscadd: Robotics can make Advanced Lungs (programming 2, biomech 4), which are
      compatible with all species and filter out some gasses (N2O and plasma), up
      to certain partial pressures.
  - rscadd: Livers are also modular and can be set to enhance "natural" removal rates
      of reagents. Nothing yet makes any use of this, so all livers are standard UNTIL
      YOU CODE IT.
  - rscadd: Livers which are bruised will deal toxin damage to their owner if the
      user has any toxic reagents in their system. Ethanol with a bruised liver is
      extremely dangerous.
  - rscadd: Livers become damaged over time if their owner has a lot of toxin damage.
      Doctors beware.
  - rscadd: Eyes are modular and Advanced Type 1 eyes can grant enhanced nightvision
      and built-in welder goggles.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added cages. Mobs inside cages can interact with the outside world, unless
      the cage's cover is closed. Alt-clicking a cage will toggle its cover. Cages
      with closed covers can be used to safely transport hostile animals (or assistants).
  - rscadd: Cages can be crafted with 6 plasteel sheets.
2016-02-22:
  Sood:
  - bugfix: Plasmen now react to oxygen and actually need plasma to breathe again.
      Blame N3X for everything it's fine :^)

2016-02-24:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: 'Fixed electric chairs not working. To prevent confusion, electric chairs
      now start on. To use an electric chair: Screwdriver on electropack, apply helmet,
      use on chair. Activate the electric chair with a remote signaler tuned to the
      electropack''s frequency and code.'
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added boomerangs - heavy throwing weapons that can be crafted from wooden
      planks. When thrown, they fly in an arc around the target and return to your
      hands.

  - bugfix: Fixed boomerangs spinning forever. Fixed boomerangs doing only a fraction
      of their actual damage on impact

  - rscadd: Vampires have to enable the Bite special attack to drain blood. Vampires
      can bite while wearing masks.
  jeroen52:

      they may hold less than 14 items depending on their total combined size.
  - tweak: Toolboxes can now hold many general Engineering items they couldn't hold
      before. This includes material sheets, power cells, floor tiles, metal rods,
      RCD, RPD, tile painter, light replacer, improved welding tools, and the station
      blueprints.
  Sood:
  - tweak: Holy water and bibles can now be used to de-thrall vamp thralls.
  - tweak: Holy water deconversion occurs in on_mob_life, so splashing them with it
      might not be as effective as injecting/ingesting.
  Unid:
  - tweak: The damage spears deal is now affected by the sharpness of the shard used
      to create it
  - tweak: Creation of a spear now takes some time, and can be interrupted

      will appear gibberish and have a static sound.
  - rscadd: An admin may send an ungibberish message to the crew even when the link
      is broken, but he will be prompted first asking if he is sure.

  - tgs: Ported automatic material stacking from TG, full credits to MrPerson. This
      means that some stackable items (such as floortiles, cable coils, metal sheets
      etc) will now try to stack with eachother when they're in the same tile. This
      allows you to, for example, drag a floortile behind yourself to scoop up all
      the loose tiles in a hallway.
  - tweak: Silicate formula now results in 9 units instead of 3.
  Duny:

      and will fuck up if built vertically.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added windoors behind plastic flaps in places where simply deconstructing
      plastic flaps would allow anyone to enter.'
  - rscadd: 'Deff: Added a bar of soap in both custodial closets.'
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: It is now more obvious that you have to emag bots (think floorbots, beepsky,
      ed-209's, cleanbots, every bot ever) twice to get them to behave naughty.
  - experiment: Did you know you have to emag bots twice to make them actually get
      emagged? The first time only unlocks the controls for everyone to use.
  - imageadd: The bunsen burner now has a better sprite.
  - bugfix: Voicechangers can now properly choose the clown mask option to morph into.
  - tweak: 'Pushing someone pulling an occupied rollerbed is now treated like pushing

      heavy vine icon.
  - rscadd: You can now burn newspapers, just like you can with papers. Most of the

      newspapers deal a miniscule amount of damage when you hit things with them (ever
      been hit by a rolled up newspaper? It hurts.)
  - tweak: Goliaths are more obviously dead when dead.
  - rscadd: In order to break their vow, mimes now have a spell again instead of having

      verb that's added is in the object tab.

      do need hands to use TK though, see above.

  - tweak: Changed instant death limit of medical nanobots to 20u. 5-20u is a danger
      zone that CAN result in horrors, the likelihood of which increases the more
      damage has been healed while nanobots have been above 5 units.
  - rscadd: Added different species of cyber horror for each playable race (except
      diona, because nanobots have no effect on dionae)
  - tweak: Made cryoxadone turn medical nanobots back into normal ones. This is both
      to discourage use in cryo mixes and act as a way to counteract nanobot overdoses.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Added tournament lances - very long spears that are too heavy to use in
      normal combat. When traveling at fast speeds, tournament lances can be couched
      to deliver a devastating blow to anybody standing in your way (damage depends

      belts are now built with their own machine frame which doesn''t require wiring
      and can be walked over. This new conveyor belt frame will also copy the direction
      you''re facing when building it. To make a conveyor belt assembly: Build it
      from 5 metal sheets, just like a machine frame.'
  - imgadd: Conveyor belt assembly sprites courtesy of Blithering.
  - rscadd: Newly built conveyor belts will now automatically try to copy the frequency
      and ID tag of any other conveyor belts immediately next to them. This lets you
      easily create long conveyor belt lines without having to configure every single
      one of them, so long as you configured the first one before building the others.
  - rscadd: 'Multitool buffer cloning now works on conveyor belts: Add a conveyor
      belt/conveyor switch to a Multitool''s buffer, click the Multitool in your hand
      to enable cloning mode, then click on a conveyor belt. It will instantly copy
      the frequency and ID tag from buffer, and if the buffer was taken from a conveyor
      belt, it will also copy it''s direction.'

      this way you know who the one true god to pray to is.

      is neutral) that it won't shoot other members of.

  Shadowmech88:

      the status of the mob being digested, with the 4th finishing them off.
  - tweak: Grabbing someone to the point that it says '(now hands)' no longer causes

      it to pretty much instantly gib.

      humans into those nests. Incidentally this means that xenobio will be able to
      create real xenos if they manage to gold slime an alien queen into existence!
  - tweak: NPC xenos no longer instantly break walls, instead they cover them with
      hyper acid that destroys them over 5 to 10 seconds. Not a very impactful change,
      but looks nice.
  - imageadd: Mobs stuck onto xeno nests now visually appear partially inside nest.
  - rscadd: Xeno weeds now progressively die out over time when the weed nodes are
      destroyed.
  - tweak: Xeno eggs now check for nearby potential victims as soon as they become
      grown, rather than having to wait for a valid human to walk nearby. This way
      they can jump onto victims that had been stuck onto nests before they were fully
      grown.
  - rscadd: You can attack burst xeno egg to fully remove them now.
  - tweak: All hot weapons now deal full damage to xeno eggs, previously only lit
      welder did.
  - tweak: Plasma cutters are now hot (which means you can light up your cigarette
      with one)
  - tweak: Getting stuck onto a xeno nest will stop you from bleeding out (from external
      wounds), as well as keep you supplied on a bit of inaprovaline, leporazine,
      and dexaline, sensibly improving your chances of survival (as well as the chances
      for a successful facehugger rape).
  - tweak: Facehuggers will now target monkeys as well as humans by themselves.
  - tweak: monkeys now appear bellow bedsheets layer items when lying down.
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Fireballs now move faster, so you're a bit less likely to run into it right
      after casting.
  xpcybic:
  - bugfix: Fixed the check in/out computer prompting twice when filtering by category.
      Fixed selecting 'all' not actually working.
  - spellcheck: Corrected the radio frequencies on the DJ satellite and ace reporter
      intercom manuals
2016-04-27:
  9600bauds:
  - tweak: Masks that can't be flipped now simply won't have a 'Flip Mask' button,
      as opposed to having a 'Flip Mask' button that does nothing but takes up space
      anyways.
2016-04-29:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: Blobs now emit a cloud of purple smoke over whatever they are affecting.
      So now you get a clear visual feedback when someone gets attacked by them, or
      they destroy something (wall or item).
  - rscadd: Huge revamp of the blob's visuals. Blobs now support two kind of looks.
      classic ones (made from 32x32 dmi) and new ones (made from 64x64 dmi)
  - rscadd: The new looks feature added overlays, animations, such as connections
      between the blobs, or various feedback animations (normal blob transmitting
      a pulse, factory producing a mob, resource producing a point, etc)
  - rscadd: The new looks also features a damage overlay, letting you know approximately
      how much health the blob part has. In the classic look, only the normal blobs
      have a damaged sprite.
  - rscadd: When a new blob gets created (through game mode, random event, or admin
      spawning), the overmind player gets to choose the blob's looks.
  - rscadd: Admins can set the looks of every blobs in the world by the push of a
      new button under the Fun tab.
  - rscadd: Resource blobs now look darker if the overmind they were connected to
      has died. Other overminds can hover near it to take ownership of them and re-activate
      them.
  - tweak: Overminds are now immune to singularities, their pull, and Nar-Sie.
  - rscadd: When a blob gets pulsed, it will now hurt any mob standing on their tile.
      Telescience teleporting you right next to the core so you can destroy it without
      any danger is no longer a viable strategy, unless you have a really good armor,
      a really powerful gun, and even then it will require some testing.
  - bugfix: Blobs cannot destroy docking ports anymore.
  - bugfix: The Blob Overmind's HUD now properly indicates how much health his core
      has.
  - rscadd: Added a lot of messages to Blob Overminds that trigger under a variety
      of conditions. Such as blobs near their core dying, a special blob that they've
      placed having been destroyed, or their core getting damaged.
  - rscadd: If there are multiple Blob Overminds in the world, they get instantly
      notified by the death of one of them. They also get notified by the death of
      any blob core, whether it had an overmind or not.
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Adds the mahoguny and the siren as admin-spawnable guns.
  - rscadd: Adds buckshot shells, orderable from Cargo in the shotgun shells crate.
  - tweak: The shotgun shells crate now contains a box of each kind of shell instead
      of ten loose lethal shells.
  - tweak: The railgun and blunderbuss can now be worn in the belt slot.
  - tweak: Diona now properly take increased burn damage from electrical shocks, and
      golems now properly take decreased burn damage from electrical shocks.
  - rscadd: All metal foam reactions will now create metal foam floors if they are
      on a space tile. Metal foam floors are airtight, but flimsy.
  - tweak: Metal foam reactions made with aluminum will no longer create metal foam
      walls.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Surgically attached limbs no longer magically transform when you attach
      them to another species' body (this means you can create a human with vox head,
      tajaran arms and muton legs).
  - tweak: Slightly changed how species restricted clothing works in respect to the
      above change. Now it's possible to, for example, wear vox magboots as a human
      - but only if both of the human's feet are vox talons.
2016-04-30:
  Intigracy:
  - bugfix: EMP grenades now properly delete themselves after they trigger.
  Unid:
  - rscadd: Vox traders now spawn with some money and coins.
  - rscadd: When vox traders spawn, they have an option to start with a traveler's
      ID. The ID has no access, and is only used for identification. Lore-wise, a
      traveler's ID is required to legally travel in human-controlled territories.
2016-05-01:
  Cloroxygen:
  - rscadd: Added Stationary Assembler MMIs - SAMMIs
2016-05-02:
  Zth:
  - rscadd: Slime humans (dna mutantrace) can now heal from electricity. Stun from
      shocks don't last as much as other races
2016-05-04:
  Sood:
  - bugfix: Players will no longer be selected twice for the same antag role.
  - bugfix: Portable and wall-mounted flashers no longer flash through sunglasses.
2016-05-06:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: The color of cult runes now matches the species blood color of whoever
      wrote it.
  - tweak: Tweaked the way cult runes look and pulsate a bit.
  - tweak: NPC hostile mobs with ranged weapons will no longer fire if there's a friendly
      unity between them and their target. Hivebots, aliens, syndicate agents, russians,
      etc, should stop killing each others now.
  - tweak: Ghosts now appear above the blob layer.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds now get notified when a new overmind appears in a blob
      core.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds now have a "damage overlay" that updates as their core
      takes damage. Similar to the one humans have when they take damage (screen borders
      become dark/reddish).
  - rscadd: Most of the Blob Overmind notifications added in the last update now have
      a (JUMP) button, so for example you can immediately find which of your blob
      nodes just got destroyed.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds have a new verb called "Call Overminds", which sends a
      notification to all the other overminds, along with a button allowing them to
      jump to you.
  - rscadd: Blob Overminds that spawn in a blob core created by an Overmind are now
      called Blob Cerebrate. So they can easily tell which one of them was the original
      one (and the only one who can place new cores)
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: Flesh to stone now lasts for 2.5 minutes rather than 8.5 minutes.
  Skullyton:
  - rscadd: Adds back-from-the-dead regeneration for simple mobs, and adds it to certain
      mobs. Said mobs will need to have their bodies destroyed in some way to keep
      them down.
2016-05-07:
  Intigracy:
  - tweak: You may now only turn gas masks into ghetto space helmets, not every kind
      of mask that covers your face.
  - bugfix: Flipping a gas mask that's in the process of being turned into a ghetto
      space helmet no longer changes the icon incorrectly.
  cumoverme:
  - tweak: Fixed Ministation giving you stealing objectives for items which weren't
      in the station.
2016-05-08:
  Deity Link:
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) Blob Overminds now have their own amazing custom HUD. Points
      gauge on the left, Health gauge on the right. The health gauge start flashing
      when it gets low.
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) Buttons that require more points than you currently have appear
      grayscale.
  - rscadd: (BLOB HUD) You can always jump back to your core using the small button
      to the top left. The first 24 special blobs that you've created (not counting
      the ones that got destroyed) also appear at the top, and you can quickly teleport
      from one to another by clicking them.
  - rscdel: Removed the obsolete and broken Blob random event.
  - rscadd: Added two new random events, Blob Cluster and Blob Conglomerate. The former
      is like a medium intensity meteor shower, sending a handful of blobs and node
      blobs at the station (about as rare as Communications Blackout). The later is
      a high intensity meteor storm, sending blobs, node blobs, and a few blob cores
      (I had 2-3 cores per showers during testing. This one is much rarer, one of
      the rarest events in fact, along with alien infestation and electrical storm).
      Both events can only trigger after 30 minutes have elapsed.
  - soundadd: Blobs now make sounds when they attack mobs.
  - experiment: Added a new meteor gun intended for testing and debugging that lets
      its user choose which type of meteor to fire.
  - bugfix: As confirmed by dylan, meteors aren't supposed to move from a Z Level
      to the next. So it's getting fixed at last.
  - soundadd: Added a few new server restart sound files.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Vomiting now removes some chemicals from your body.
  - rscadd: You can now vomit into a toilet by standing over it. It's also possible
      to vomit into a reagent container (like a bucket or a beaker) by either standing
      over it, or holding it while vomiting. Vomiting into a container partially fills
      it.
  - rscadd: Pools of vomit now dry over time. You can use a dropper or a syringe on
      a fresh pool of vomit to extract some of the substance.
2016-05-09:
  Intigracy:
  - rscadd: Adds miniature black holes. They function exactly like bags of holding
      except they fit in pockets. Currently admin spawn only for obvious balance reasons.
2016-05-14:
  9600bauds:
  - rscadd: 'Made conveyor construction even simpler: Upon being built, conveyor belts
      will now try to copy configuration from adjacent conveyor switches, as well
      as other belts. Conveyor switches now also start with a random ID tag, rather
      than null.'
  Deity Link:
  - tweak: Blob Conglomerates can now only happen if there are 25 or more living players
      on the station. Including at least a sec officer and an engineer.
  - rscadd: Bomberman Bombs now affect blobs.
  Probe1:
  - rscadd: New Tradeship for Vox Traders on Box.  Requires a Vox Trader ID to access
      and use.  Make sure you accept that ID at round start if you want an easy way
      to trade.  Arrivals and Vox Outpost have been slightly modified to accomodate
      it, as well as a few minor bug fixes along the way to the general areas.
  Shadowmech88:
  - rscadd: Added more clown names.
  Sood:
  - rscadd: Admins may now toggle wages for all personal and departmental accounts
      in the game panel. This starts off disabled and must be added to config.txt
      to be auto-enabled.
  - rscadd: Admins can now modify the balance and wage payout of individual accounts,
      also via game panel.
  - tweak: Accounts database machine can now see what an account would earn per paycheck.
  - tweak: Power cables will no longer shock you unless you click on a cable end or
      are using tools on them.
  - tweak: This means that wirecutters on cables still might shock you but bruise
      packs will not.
  - tweak: UNLESS IT IS A CABLE END.
  Unid:
  - tweak: Refactored away missions.
  - rscadd: Admins can now spawn away missions during the round using a new button
      in the Admin tab.
2016-05-15:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed flashbangs not affecting mobs without a player controlling them.
  - bugfix: Fixed flashbang sound dropoff not working, always giving maximum stun
      time to players with no ear protection.
  - tweak: 'As per server poll, flashbangs will now affect cyborgs and simple animals.
      See the poll here: ss13.moe/index.php/poll/38'
2016-05-18:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed flashbangs working through walls and while ventcrawling (sorry!)
  Deity Link:
  - bugfix: Escape attempts from alien nests no longer carry over when you get trapped
      again on that same nest.
  - tweak: Aliens can no longer trap human players on nests if they are standing up.
      They need to at least tackle them first, or make them fall one way or another.
      Doesn't apply to braindeads.
2016-05-20:
  9600bauds:
  - bugfix: Fixed MoMMIs being able to do certain things while ventcrawling.
  - bugfix: Atmospherics pipes no longer act like a bomb shelter in explosions.
  - bugfix: Combat mechs now start with a tracking beacon, like medical and mining
      mechs. As always, the beacon can be removed the same way you remove the power
      cell.
  Sood:
  - bugfix: Happiest Mask will no longer make you laugh while it is in your pocket.
