      phylactery well, for he is immortal!

      crew is to catch him during a vunerable moment.

      is used for all the remaining calculations instead of Armour (Eg: 80 Melee -

  - rscadd: The spells disintegrate and flesh to stone have had their mechanics changed.
      Using these spells will spawn a special touch weapon in a free hand (your dominant
      hand if possible) that can then be used to inflict the spell on the target of
      your choice. Having the touch weapon out is obvious, this is not a stealth based
      change. Clicking the spell while the hand is out will let you return the charge
      without using it.
  - rscdel: The spell won't begin to recharge until the hand attack is either used
      or returned. Additionally these changes mean you can no longer use these spells
      while stunned or handcuffed. As a suggestion remember that the mutate spell
      allows you to break out of cuffs very easily, and warping abilities will keep
      you from getting cuffed to begin with!

      be used to fuck with your sprite

      not incur this behavior.
  - tweak: In response to complaints about rogue drones, Nanotrasen engineers have
      allowed factory resets on all drones by simply using a wrench.
  - experiment: Central Command reminds drones to immediately retreat, if possible,
      when a law override is begun. Not doing so may anger the gods and incur their
      wrath!

      prototype hardsuit's built in scan visor.
  - rscadd: Supporting this new design, Nanotrasen has seen fit to provide blueprints
      for Science Goggles to the station's protolathe.

      space, more secrets have been uncovered of their traditional fighting techniques.

  - tweak: Slimes now attaches themselves to mobs via buckling.
2015-10-16:
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: Added a reconnect option to the file menu. This will allow you to reconnect
      to the game server without closing and re-opening the game window. This should
      also prevent another byond ad from playing during reconnections.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: A gamebreaking bug has been fixed with buckets. You can now wear them
      on your head.
  bgobandit:

      to drone legs. They are no longer affected by lack of gravity or spacewind!

  bgobandit:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen loves recycling! In the highly unlikely occasion that your
      space station accumulates gibs, scoop 'em up and bring them to chemistry to
      recycle into soap, candles, or even delicious meat product!
  - rscadd: L3 biohazard closets now contain bio-bag satchels for the safe collection
      of biowaste products, such as slime extracts.

      glass) is now done by clicking them, similar to spray. Reagent dispensers (watertank,

      use the reagent container's transfer amount instead (except for sprays which
      get 50u for faster refilling).
2015-10-23:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 'Syndicate bomb payloads will now detonate if set on fire long enough.
      Note that the casings for the bombs is fireproof, so if you want to set fire
      to a bombcore you''ll need to remove it from the case first (cut all wires,
      then crowbar it out). A reassurance from our explosives department: it is, and
      always has been, impossible to detonate a syndicate bomb that isn''t ticking
      with wirecutters alone.'
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Geiger counters have been added and are obtainable from autolathes and
      EngiVends. They will measure the severity of radiation pulses while in your
      pockets, belt, or hands. One can scan a mob's radiation level by switching to
      Help intent and clicking on it. These counters never really discard the radiation
      they store, and rumor has it this can be used in nefarious ways...
  - tweak: When a mob is impacted by radiation, the radiation is now relayed to all
      items on the mob.
2015-10-24:
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The friendly gold slime reaction now spawns three mobs.
  phil235:
  - tweak: Changed the effects of alcohol to be more realistic. The effects of alcohol
      now appear twice as fast. Drunkenness now scales with how much alcohol is in
      you, not how long you've been drinking. This means drinking very little but
      continuously no longer makes you very drunk, or confused/slurring for a long
      time or give you alcohol poisoning. The dizziness and slurring effects now properly
      scale with how drunk you are (and dizziness is generally more pronounced).
2015-10-25:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The spell Charge has been added to the spellbook. It can be used to extend
      the life of magic and energy weapons and even reset the cooldowns of held wizards!

      and raises the dead! Can't be used on yourself however.

      suicide has been fixed.

2015-10-26:
  Fox P McCloud:
  - tweak: Standardizes the slowdown of most spacesuits to 1 as opposed to 2.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 48x48 pixel mode (x1.5 zoom) has been added to the Icons menu (top left).
      While playing in 32x32 or 64x64 will still provide a clearer looking station,
      for those of us with resolutions that fall into the gap between the two zooms
      this can provide a more consistant looking station than stretch to fit.
  - rscadd: 96x96 pixel mode (x3 zoom) has also been added for our players who enjoy
      looking at spacemen on their 4k monitors at a crisp and consistent scale.
  - tweak: The lich spell has been subjected to some gentle nerfing. When you die
      a string of energy will tie your new body to your old body for a short time,
      aiding others in determining your location. The duration of this beam scales
      with the number of deaths you've avoided.
  - tweak: Additionally the post revival stun now also scales in this way.
  - tweak: The spell will also fail if the item and the wizard don't share the same
      z level, though the nature of space means the odds of the item (or the wizard)
      looping around back to the station is pretty high.
  - rscadd: The spell is still really good.
2015-10-27:
  Joan:
  - bugfix: You can now click on things under timestop effects, instead of clicking
      the effect and looking like a fool.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added a zombie mob that turns its kills into more zombies. Currently adminspawn
      and xenobio only.
  - rscadd: Using water with a red slime extract will now yield a speed potion. Using
      the speed potion on an item of clothing will paint it red and remove its slowdown.
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: You may now access the setup character screen when not in the lobby via
      the game preferences verb in the preferences tab
  - rscadd: The round end restart delay can now be configured by server operators.
      New servers will default to 90 seconds while old servers will default to the
      old 25 seconds until they import the config option to their server.
2015-10-28:

      (jobs only) or the medHUD of humans.
  - rscadd: Ghost will now get clickable icon alerts from events such as being put
      in a cloner, drones being created, Nar-sie being summoned, among others. The
      older chat messages were kept. These alerts can not be toggled.
2015-10-29:
  Kor:
  - tweak: Slightly changed what items spawn on the captain vs in his locker, hopefully
      saving some annoying inventory shuffle at roundstart.
2015-10-30:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now split if they contain 200 units of slime jelly, and
      slimepeople will now slowly generate slime jelly up to 200 units provided they
      are very well fed. Split slimepeople are NOT player controlled, but rather the
      original slime person can swap between the two mobs at will. If one of the slimepeople
      should die under player control, the player won't be able to swap back to their
      living body. Splitting only creates a new body, any items you have on you are
      not duplicated.
  - rscadd: Slimepeople now take half damage from sources of heat, but double damage
      from sources of cold. Lasers good, Space bad.
2015-11-01:
  Gun Hog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen listens! After numerous complaints and petitions from Security
      personnel regarding energy weapon upkeep, we have authorized the construction
      and maintenance of your station's weapon rechargers. As an added bonus, we have
      also provided a more modular design for the devices, allowing for greater recharge
      rates if fitted with a more efficient capacitor!
  - rscadd: Added Diagnostic HUDs! They can be used to view the health and cell status
      of borgs and mechs. Silicons have them built in, Roboticists get two in their
      locker, and the RD's hardsuit has one built in.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The number of roundstart head revolutionaries nows depends on the roundstart
      security force as well as the roundstart heads
  - rscadd: The maximum number of head revs is 3, the minimum is 1. If there is fewer
      than three station heads there will never be more than that number of head revs
      at roundstart. For every three vacant security roles (Head of Security/Warden/Security
      Officer/Detective) at roundstart the number of starting head revs will be reduced
      by 1.
  - rscadd: Head revolutionaries can be gained during play if the security/head roles
      are filled. They are drawn from existing revolutionaries.
  - rscadd: Added dental implant surgery. While targeting the mouth drill a hole in
      a tooth then stick a pill in there for hands free later use.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added an experimental control console for Xenobiology. Ask the admins
      if you'd like to try it out. It may not work on maps other than Box if they
      have renamed the Xenobiology Lab.
  - rscadd: Injecting blood into a cerulean slime will yield a special one use set
      of blueprints that will allow you to expand the territory your camera can cover.
  Kor and Remie:
  - rscadd: Added as series of laser reflector structures, the frame of which can
      be built with 5 metal sheets.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 5 glass sheets creates a mirror that will reflect
      lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 10 reinforced glass sheets creates a double
      sided mirror that reflects lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with a single diamond sheet creates a box that will
      redirect all lasers that hit it from any angle in a single direction.

      for flashbang deaf effect
  JJRcop:
  - tweak: Chronosuits have had their movement revised, they now take time to teleport

      unless you stop moving for a short moment, or press the new ' Teleport Now'
      button.
  - rscadd: Added new outfit that allows admins to dress people up in the chrono equipment
      easier.
  Jalleo:

      due to this change all smartfridges will temporarily be unable to stack contents.
  Joan:
  - tweak: Revenant draining now takes about 5 seconds to complete and can be interrupted
      by dragging the target away.
  - tweak: Revenants can now tell if they are currently visible.
  - tweak: Revenant ability costs tweaked; Defile now costs 40 essence to cast, Overload
      Lights now costs 45 essence to cast, and Malfunction now costs 50 essence to
      cast.
  - tweak: Malfunction now affects non-machine objects, even if they're not being
      held by a human.
  - tweak: Defile does an extremely low amount of toxin damage to humans and confuses,
      but does much less stamina damage and stuns the revenant for slightly longer.
  - tweak: Overload Lights will no longer shock if the light is broken after a light
      is chosen to shock an area.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Using water on a dark blue slime extract will now yield a new potion capable
      of completely fireproofing clothing items.

  LordPidey:

      in IV drips, when blood supplies are low.  Simple pills will not suffice.

      runs into them.

      things.
  MrStonedOne:
  - bugfix: Away mission loading will no longer improperly expand the width of the
      game world to two times the size of the away mission map.

      once it's done charging.
  - rscadd: Getting hit by a bolt will do a flat 30 burn now, as opposed to scaling
      with how long the wizard spent charging the spell. Unless said wizard made a
      habit of charging lightning bolt to near maximum every time this is a buff to
      damage.
  - rscdel: Every time the bolt jumps the next shock will do five less burn damage.
  - rscadd: Lightning bolts can still jump back to the same body, so the maximum number

  - rscdel: Cooldown raised to 20 seconds, up from 15

      seconds to 10 seconds. Rank 5 time stop now has a cooldown of 10 seconds, up
      from 9, and is effectively a permastun.

      not opening right away.
  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: Teleprods can now be constructed. Make them via tablecrafting, or by putting
      a bluespace crystal onto a stunprod. They warp the target to a random nearby

      victim a brief stun. Like stunprods, they require a power cell to function.
