      (between 3 and 6 minutes) but the cloning time and biomass use can be reduced

      turns user into a hulk.  Unlike a hulk, however, Horrors can punch people so
      hard they have a 25% chance of flying down a hallway.  Can also force open doors
      (50% chance after 5 sec).  Throwing speed bonus.  Takes twice as much fire damage
      as a normal human.  <u>YOU CANNOT RETURN TO HUMAN FORM AFTER CHANGING INTO A
      HORROR.</u>

  Angelite Entyshak:

      the doors, the kitchen's floor, etc...)
  - bugfix: Fixed many objects not appearing on pictures if they have been pulled
      in certain directions.
  - tweak: Mobs will now always appear to face south on pictures. A necessary evil
      related to human species and limbs. humanoids would always face south while
      their clothes would face their actual direction, causing an ugly dissonance.

      their clothes, please do. I am unable to.

      before he gets summoned get a message)

      way.<br>Plants now have ideal heat, light and pressure values, as well as tolerances
      for differences.<br>Plants can produce multiple different kinds of product.<br>Reagent

      the new code.<br>Space vines now make use of seed data if spawned with a reference
      and can be harvested from.<br>Vines now cause physical damage if they are carnivorous,
      and inject reagents if their seed data includes them.<br>Vines will die if they
