  Dylanstrategie:
  - wip: Changed cloner functionality. Base cloning time has seen a pretty steep increase
      (between 3 and 6 minutes) but the cloning time and biomass use can be reduced
      by replacing the cloning pod's parts. This change should make cloning people
      less of a choice early in the round and reverse "clone everything" mentality
      with the recent changes to defibrillators and other planned changes

      and hopefully an announcement sound if someone generates it
  N3X15:
  - wip: Horror Form for changeling has been added.  Costs 30 points, effectively
      turns user into a hulk.  Unlike a hulk, however, Horrors can punch people so
      hard they have a 25% chance of flying down a hallway.  Can also force open doors
      (50% chance after 5 sec).  Throwing speed bonus.  Takes twice as much fire damage
      as a normal human.  <u>YOU CANNOT RETURN TO HUMAN FORM AFTER CHANGING INTO A
      HORROR.</u>
  - rscadd: New traitor panel control for adjusting genomes of changelings. (No more
