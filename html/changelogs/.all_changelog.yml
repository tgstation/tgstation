      phylactery well, for he is immortal!

      crew is to catch him during a vunerable moment.

      is used for all the remaining calculations instead of Armour (Eg: 80 Melee -

  - rscadd: The spells disintegrate and flesh to stone have had their mechanics changed.
      Using these spells will spawn a special touch weapon in a free hand (your dominant
      hand if possible) that can then be used to inflict the spell on the target of
      your choice. Having the touch weapon out is obvious, this is not a stealth based
      change. Clicking the spell while the hand is out will let you return the charge
      without using it.
  - rscdel: The spell won't begin to recharge until the hand attack is either used
      or returned. Additionally these changes mean you can no longer use these spells
      while stunned or handcuffed. As a suggestion remember that the mutate spell
      allows you to break out of cuffs very easily, and warping abilities will keep
      you from getting cuffed to begin with!

      be used to fuck with your sprite

      not incur this behavior.
  - tweak: In response to complaints about rogue drones, Nanotrasen engineers have
      allowed factory resets on all drones by simply using a wrench.
  - experiment: Central Command reminds drones to immediately retreat, if possible,
      when a law override is begun. Not doing so may anger the gods and incur their
      wrath!

      prototype hardsuit's built in scan visor.
  - rscadd: Supporting this new design, Nanotrasen has seen fit to provide blueprints
      for Science Goggles to the station's protolathe.

      space, more secrets have been uncovered of their traditional fighting techniques.

  - tweak: Slimes now attaches themselves to mobs via buckling.
2015-10-16:
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: Added a reconnect option to the file menu. This will allow you to reconnect
      to the game server without closing and re-opening the game window. This should
      also prevent another byond ad from playing during reconnections.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: A gamebreaking bug has been fixed with buckets. You can now wear them
      on your head.
  bgobandit:

      to drone legs. They are no longer affected by lack of gravity or spacewind!

  bgobandit:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen loves recycling! In the highly unlikely occasion that your
      space station accumulates gibs, scoop 'em up and bring them to chemistry to
      recycle into soap, candles, or even delicious meat product!
  - rscadd: L3 biohazard closets now contain bio-bag satchels for the safe collection
      of biowaste products, such as slime extracts.

      glass) is now done by clicking them, similar to spray. Reagent dispensers (watertank,

      use the reagent container's transfer amount instead (except for sprays which
      get 50u for faster refilling).
2015-10-23:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 'Syndicate bomb payloads will now detonate if set on fire long enough.
      Note that the casings for the bombs is fireproof, so if you want to set fire
      to a bombcore you''ll need to remove it from the case first (cut all wires,
      then crowbar it out). A reassurance from our explosives department: it is, and
      always has been, impossible to detonate a syndicate bomb that isn''t ticking
      with wirecutters alone.'
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Geiger counters have been added and are obtainable from autolathes and
      EngiVends. They will measure the severity of radiation pulses while in your
      pockets, belt, or hands. One can scan a mob's radiation level by switching to
      Help intent and clicking on it. These counters never really discard the radiation
      they store, and rumor has it this can be used in nefarious ways...
  - tweak: When a mob is impacted by radiation, the radiation is now relayed to all
      items on the mob.
2015-10-24:
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The friendly gold slime reaction now spawns three mobs.
  phil235:
  - tweak: Changed the effects of alcohol to be more realistic. The effects of alcohol
      now appear twice as fast. Drunkenness now scales with how much alcohol is in
      you, not how long you've been drinking. This means drinking very little but
      continuously no longer makes you very drunk, or confused/slurring for a long
      time or give you alcohol poisoning. The dizziness and slurring effects now properly
      scale with how drunk you are (and dizziness is generally more pronounced).
2015-10-25:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The spell Charge has been added to the spellbook. It can be used to extend
      the life of magic and energy weapons and even reset the cooldowns of held wizards!

      and raises the dead! Can't be used on yourself however.

      suicide has been fixed.

2015-10-26:
  Fox P McCloud:
  - tweak: Standardizes the slowdown of most spacesuits to 1 as opposed to 2.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 48x48 pixel mode (x1.5 zoom) has been added to the Icons menu (top left).
      While playing in 32x32 or 64x64 will still provide a clearer looking station,
      for those of us with resolutions that fall into the gap between the two zooms
      this can provide a more consistant looking station than stretch to fit.
  - rscadd: 96x96 pixel mode (x3 zoom) has also been added for our players who enjoy
      looking at spacemen on their 4k monitors at a crisp and consistent scale.
  - tweak: The lich spell has been subjected to some gentle nerfing. When you die
      a string of energy will tie your new body to your old body for a short time,
      aiding others in determining your location. The duration of this beam scales
      with the number of deaths you've avoided.
  - tweak: Additionally the post revival stun now also scales in this way.
  - tweak: The spell will also fail if the item and the wizard don't share the same
      z level, though the nature of space means the odds of the item (or the wizard)
      looping around back to the station is pretty high.
  - rscadd: The spell is still really good.
2015-10-27:
  Joan:
  - bugfix: You can now click on things under timestop effects, instead of clicking
      the effect and looking like a fool.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added a zombie mob that turns its kills into more zombies. Currently adminspawn
      and xenobio only.
  - rscadd: Using water with a red slime extract will now yield a speed potion. Using
      the speed potion on an item of clothing will paint it red and remove its slowdown.
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: You may now access the setup character screen when not in the lobby via
      the game preferences verb in the preferences tab
  - rscadd: The round end restart delay can now be configured by server operators.
      New servers will default to 90 seconds while old servers will default to the
      old 25 seconds until they import the config option to their server.
2015-10-28:

      (jobs only) or the medHUD of humans.
  - rscadd: Ghost will now get clickable icon alerts from events such as being put
      in a cloner, drones being created, Nar-sie being summoned, among others. The
      older chat messages were kept. These alerts can not be toggled.
2015-10-29:
  Kor:
  - tweak: Slightly changed what items spawn on the captain vs in his locker, hopefully
      saving some annoying inventory shuffle at roundstart.
2015-10-30:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now split if they contain 200 units of slime jelly, and
      slimepeople will now slowly generate slime jelly up to 200 units provided they
      are very well fed. Split slimepeople are NOT player controlled, but rather the
      original slime person can swap between the two mobs at will. If one of the slimepeople
      should die under player control, the player won't be able to swap back to their
      living body. Splitting only creates a new body, any items you have on you are
      not duplicated.
  - rscadd: Slimepeople now take half damage from sources of heat, but double damage
      from sources of cold. Lasers good, Space bad.
2015-11-01:
  Gun Hog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen listens! After numerous complaints and petitions from Security
      personnel regarding energy weapon upkeep, we have authorized the construction
      and maintenance of your station's weapon rechargers. As an added bonus, we have
      also provided a more modular design for the devices, allowing for greater recharge
      rates if fitted with a more efficient capacitor!
  - rscadd: Added Diagnostic HUDs! They can be used to view the health and cell status
      of borgs and mechs. Silicons have them built in, Roboticists get two in their
      locker, and the RD's hardsuit has one built in.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The number of roundstart head revolutionaries nows depends on the roundstart
      security force as well as the roundstart heads
  - rscadd: The maximum number of head revs is 3, the minimum is 1. If there is fewer
      than three station heads there will never be more than that number of head revs
      at roundstart. For every three vacant security roles (Head of Security/Warden/Security
      Officer/Detective) at roundstart the number of starting head revs will be reduced
      by 1.
  - rscadd: Head revolutionaries can be gained during play if the security/head roles
      are filled. They are drawn from existing revolutionaries.
  - rscadd: Added dental implant surgery. While targeting the mouth drill a hole in
      a tooth then stick a pill in there for hands free later use.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added an experimental control console for Xenobiology. Ask the admins
      if you'd like to try it out. It may not work on maps other than Box if they
      have renamed the Xenobiology Lab.
  - rscadd: Injecting blood into a cerulean slime will yield a special one use set
      of blueprints that will allow you to expand the territory your camera can cover.
  Kor and Remie:
  - rscadd: Added as series of laser reflector structures, the frame of which can
      be built with 5 metal sheets.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 5 glass sheets creates a mirror that will reflect
      lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 10 reinforced glass sheets creates a double
      sided mirror that reflects lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with a single diamond sheet creates a box that will
      redirect all lasers that hit it from any angle in a single direction.

      for flashbang deaf effect
  JJRcop:
  - tweak: Chronosuits have had their movement revised, they now take time to teleport

      unless you stop moving for a short moment, or press the new ' Teleport Now'
      button.
  - rscadd: Added new outfit that allows admins to dress people up in the chrono equipment
      easier.
  Jalleo:

      due to this change all smartfridges will temporarily be unable to stack contents.
  Joan:
  - tweak: Revenant draining now takes about 5 seconds to complete and can be interrupted
      by dragging the target away.
  - tweak: Revenants can now tell if they are currently visible.
  - tweak: Revenant ability costs tweaked; Defile now costs 40 essence to cast, Overload
      Lights now costs 45 essence to cast, and Malfunction now costs 50 essence to
      cast.
  - tweak: Malfunction now affects non-machine objects, even if they're not being
      held by a human.
  - tweak: Defile does an extremely low amount of toxin damage to humans and confuses,
      but does much less stamina damage and stuns the revenant for slightly longer.
  - tweak: Overload Lights will no longer shock if the light is broken after a light
      is chosen to shock an area.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Using water on a dark blue slime extract will now yield a new potion capable
      of completely fireproofing clothing items.

  LordPidey:

      in IV drips, when blood supplies are low.  Simple pills will not suffice.

      things.
  MrStonedOne:
  - bugfix: Away mission loading will no longer improperly expand the width of the

      once it's done charging.

      damage.
  - rscdel: Every time the bolt jumps the next shock will do five less burn damage.
  - rscadd: Lightning bolts can still jump back to the same body, so the maximum number

  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: Teleprods can now be constructed. Make them via tablecrafting, or by putting
      a bluespace crystal onto a stunprod. They warp the target to a random nearby

  - tweak: Incen shells for the shotgun now apply extra firestacks on hit so it actually
      sets people on fire instead of turning them into a light show.
  - tweak: Incen rounds for the SAW now leave a fire trail similar to the bulldog's
      dragonsbreath round.

      of MMMiracles.

  - tweak: Your vision is now affected when you're inside something or viewing through
      a camera. You can no longer see mobs or objects when ventcrawling (unless you
      have xray for example), an xray user viewing through a camera do not see through
      walls around the camera. On the other hand, cameras with an xray upgrade let
      you see through walls. Unfocused camera now give you the same effect as when
      you are nearsighted. Being inside closets, morgue container and disposal bins
      give you some vision impairments.

      whenever they're on blobs near a node or the core.

      the expanding blob's health. Blobs still, however, expand at roughly the same
      rate as they do currently.

      armor. The damage can still be reduced by bio protection.

      by brute damage in melee.

      the 'blob' faction, such as blobbernauts and spores.

      balls. First ball comes with 32 energy (down from 300), fourth requires 256
      (down from 1200), and so on and on, doubling with each new ball. Balls after
      7 are increasingly harder to get than before, whereas balls before 6 are easier
      to get.
  - rscadd: MULTIBOLT IS BACK!
  - tweak: Be warned that in multibolt all but 1 primary bolt now have a random shocking

  - tweak: Power output of tesla massively dropped, it should no longer put out almost
      twice the power of a stage 3 singulo with maxed collectors without any balls,
      you'll need at least 3 balls for that now.
  - tweak: Tesla can now lose power, causing ball count to drop. Tesla will never
      shrink out of existence, just lose its balls.

      have the slight bomb protection that the other two had.
  - experiment: The time needed to complete most tablecrafting recipes has been cut
      in half to make tablecrafting less annoying to use.

      attacks. Brains not inside a MMI can now be attacked just like MMIs. Damaged
      brain can't be put into a robot, they can still be put inside a brainless humanoid
      corpse and cloned, but deffibing the corpse always fails (can't revive someone
      with a brain beaten to a pulp).

  - wip: This only works with the default white ghost form right now (because the
      other forms have the wrong shape or lack directional sprites), and with human
      bodies since they're the only ones that have hair. Sorry lizards and plasmamen!
      You'll get your turn next time.
  - rscadd: A new preference called Ghost Accessories. This lets you configure if
      you want your ghost sprite to show both hair and directional sprites, only directional

      and lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you: as their own setting,
      as the form they chose but without any hair or directional sprites, or as the
      simple white ghost sprite if you''re sick of those premium users with their
      rainbow ghosts.'
  - experiment: The layout of the ghost preference buttons has slightly changed. The
      old Choose Ghost Form and Choose Ghost Orbit are now a part of Ghost Customization,
      which also contains the new Ghost Accessories button. Clicking Ghost Customization
      will send you directly to Ghost Accessories if you don't have premium. The Preferences
      tab now also contains the Ghost Display button, which lets you configure how
      other ghosts appear to you.

      in the Preferences menu wouldn't save your preference update to your save file.

  Joan:
  - rscadd: Blobs attempting to attack the supermatter will instead be eaten by it.
  - experiment: This doesn't mean throwing a supermatter shard at the blob is a good

      power through this transmutation.

      neck-grabbed victim into hivemind communications after short period of time.

      you, give you intel, or even a PDA code. The link will stabilize crit victims
      to help ensure they do not die during the link.

      long, regardless of whether it was 1u, or 100u) There is a limit, however, and

  phil235:
  - tweak: Pull and Grab are merged together. Pulling stays unchanged. Using an empty
      hand with grab intent on a mob will pull them. Using an empty hand with grab
      intent on a mob that you're already pulling will try to upgrade your grip to
      aggressive grab>neck grab>kill grab. Aggressive grabs no longer stun you, but
      they act exactly like a handcuff, preventing you from using your hands until
      you escape the grip. You can break free from the grip by trying to move or using
      the resist button.

      you can remove the corruption from its brain via surgery, or just chop off the
      head to stop it coming back.
  - rscadd: Adds some stock computers and lavaland to Birdboat Station.
  - bugfix: Free Golem scientists have proved that as beings made out of stone, golems
      are immune to all electrical discharges, including the tesla.
  - rscadd: Nuclear bombs are now points of interest. Never miss a borg steal a nuke
      from the syndicate shuttle again!
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a spraycan toggles the cap.
2016-06-01:
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Added a mirror to the beach biodome. Beach Bums, rejoyce!
  pudl:
  - rscadd: The brig infirmary has received a redesign.
2016-06-02:
  Joan:
  - tweak: Closed false walls will block air.
  Lati:
  - rscadd: R&D required levels and origin tech levels have been rebalanced
  - experiment: Overall, items buildable in R&D have lower tech levels and items in
      other departments have their tech levels raised. Remember to use science goggles
      to see tech levels of items!
  - tweak: There are now level gates at high levels. R&D scientists will need help
      from others to get past these level gates.
  - tweak: Other departments such as hydroponics and genetics will be important to
      R&D's progress now and xenobio, mining and cargo are more important than before
  - tweak: Efficiency upgrades are back in R&D machines and tweaked to be less powerful
      in autolathes
  - rscdel: Reliability has been removed from all items
  - bugfix: Most bugs in R&D machines should be fixed
  PKPenguin321 & Nienhaus:
  - rscadd: Letterman jackets are now available from the ClothesMate.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: The bar has seen a redesign.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Clone pods now notify the medical channel on a successful clone. They
      also notify the medical channel if the clone dies or is horribly mutilated;
      but not if it is ejected early by authorised medical personnel.
  - rscadd: Cloning pods now are more capable of cloning humanoid species that do
      not breathe.
  - bugfix: You can only be damaged once by a shuttle's arrival. It is still unpleasant
      to be in the path of one though; try to avoid it.
  - rscadd: Adds Asteroid emergency shuttle to shuttle templates. It is a very oddly
      shaped one though, it might not be compatible with all stations.
  - rscdel: The Chaplain soulshard can only turn a body into a shade once. A released
      shade can still be reabsorbed by the stone to heal it.
  - rscadd: The shuttle manipulator now has a Fast Travel button, for those admins
      that really want a shuttle to get to where its going FAST.
2016-06-04:
  MrStonedOne:
  - bugfix: fixes see_darkness improperly hiding ghosts in certain cases.
  Xhuis:
  - tweak: Clockwork marauders can now smash walls and tables.
  - tweak: Servants are no longer turned into harvesters by Nar-Sie but instead take
      heavy brute damage and begin to bleed. Similarly, cultists are no longer converted
      by Ratvar but instead take heavy fire damage and are set ablaze.
  - rscadd: Added clockwork reclaimers. Ghosts can now click on Ratvar to become clockwork
      reclaimers - small constructs capable of forcefully converting those that still
      resist Ratvar's reign. Alt-clicking a valid target will allow the reclaimer
      to leap onto the head of any non-servant, latching onto their head and converting
      the target if they are able. The target will be outfitted with an unremovable,
      acid-proof hat version of the reclaimer. The reclaimer will be able to speak
      as normal and attack its host and anything nearby. If the reclaimer's host goes
      unconscious or dies, it will leap free.
  - rscadd: Added pinion airlocks. These airlocks can only be opened by servants and
      conventional deconstruction will not work on them. They can be created by proselytizing
      a normal airlock or from Ratvar.
  - rscadd: Added ratvarian windows. They are created when Ratvar twists the form
      of a normal window, and there are both single-direction and full-tile variants.
  - bugfix: Non-servants can no longer use clockwork proselytizers or mending motors.
  - bugfix: Servants are now deconverted properly.
  coiax:
  - bugfix: The cloning pod now sounds robotic on the radio.
  - rscadd: For extra observer drama, ghosts can now visibly see the countdown of
      syndicate bombs, nuclear devices, cloning pods, gang dominators and AI doomsday
      devices.
2016-06-05:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Clockwork structures can be damaged by projectiles and simple animals,
      and will actually drop debris when destroyed.
  - rscadd: AIs and Cyborgs that serve Ratvar can control clockwork airlocks and clockwork
      windoors.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can now proselytize windows, doors, grilles,
      and windoors.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can proselytize wall gears and alloy shards
      to produce replicant alloy. It can also proselytize replicant alloy to refill,
      in addition to refilling by attacking it with alloy.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can replace clockwork floors with clockwork
      walls and vice versa.
  - rscadd: Ratvar will convert windoors, tables, and computers in addition to everything
      else.
  - tweak: Ratvar now moves around much faster.
  - rscadd: Ratvar and Nar-Sie will break each other's objects.
  - tweak: The blind eye from a broken ocular warden now serves as a belligerent eye
      instead of as replicant alloy. The pinion lock from a deconstructed clockwork
      airlock now serves as a vanguard cogwheel instead of as replicant alloy.
  - rscadd: Clockwork walls drop a wall gear when removed by a welding tool. The wall
      gear is dense, but can be climbed over or unwrenched, and drops alloy shards
      when broken. Clockwork walls drop alloy shards when broken by other means.
  - bugfix: Fixed Nar-Sie wandering while battling Ratvar.
  - bugfix: Ratvarian Spears now last for the proper 5 minute duration.
  - bugfix: Servant communication now has ghost follow links.
  - imageadd: New sigil sprites, courtesy Skowron.
  - imageadd: Sigils of Transgression have a visual effect when stunning a target.
  - imageadd: Clockwork spears now have a visual effect when breaking.
  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: The CMO's medical HUD implant now comes with a one-use autoimplanter for
      ease of use.
  RemieRichards:
  - rscadd: Slimes may now be ordered to attack! You must be VERY good friends with
      the slime(s) to give this command, asking them to attack their friends or other
      slimes will result in them liking you less so be careful!
  X-TheDark:
  - rscadd: Mech battery replacement improved. The inserted battery's charge will
      be set to the same percentage of the removed one's (or 10%, if removed one's
      was less).
  coiax:
  - bugfix: Clicking the (F) link when an AI talks in binary chat will follow its
      camera eye, the same as when (F) is clicked for its radio chat.
  - bugfix: Laughter demons should now always let their friends go when asked correctly.
  - rscadd: Cloning pods now grab the clone's mind when the body is ejected, rather
      than when it starts cloning.
  - rscadd: Wizards have been experimenting with summoning the slightly less lethal
      "laughter demon". Please be aware that these demons appear to be nearly as dangerous
      as their slaughter cousins. But adorable, nonetheless.
  kevinz000:
  - rscadd: Gravity Guns! It is a mildly expensive R&D gun that has a 5 second cooldown
      between shots, but doesn't need to be recharged. It has two modes, attract and
      repulse. For all your gravity-manipulation needs!
2016-06-07:
  Bobylein:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen is finally able to source transparent bottles for chemistry.
  Iamgoofball:
  - experiment: The Greytide Virus got some teeth.
  Joan:
  - wip: This is a bunch of Clockwork Cult changes.
  - rscadd: Added the Clockwork Obelisk, an Application scripture that produces a
      clockwork obelisk, which can Hierophant Broadcast a large message to all servants
      or open a Spatial Gateway with 5 uses and a 10 second duration to any conscious
      servant or clockwork obelisk.
  - wip: Spatial Gateways of any source have doubled uses and duration when the target
      is a clockwork obelisk.
  - rscadd: Added the Mania Motor, an Application scripture that produces a mania
      motor, which, while active, causes hallucinations and brain damage in all nearby
      humans.
  - wip: The Mania Motor will try to convert any non-servant human directly adjacent
      to it at an additional power cost and will remove brain damage, hallucinations,
      and the druggy effect from servants.
  - rscadd: Added the Vitality Matrix, an Application scripture that produces a sigil
      that will slowly drain health from non-servants that remain on it. Servants
      that remain on the sigil will instead be healed with the vitality drained from
      non-servants.
  - wip: The Vitality Matrix can revive dead servants for a cost of 25 vitality plus
      all non-oxygen damage the servant has. If it cannot immediately revive a servant,
      it will still heal their corpse.
  - experiment: Most clockwork structures, including the Mending Motor, Interdiction
      Lens, and the newly added Clockwork Obelisk and Mania Motor, now require power
      to function.
  - wip: Mending Motors can still use alloy for power.
  - tweak: The Sigil of Transmission has been remade into a power battery and will
      power directly adjecent clockwork structures. Sigils of Transmission start off
      with 4000 power and can be recharged with Volt Void.
  - tweak: Volt Void drains somewhat more power, but will not damage the invoker unless
      they drain too much power. Invokers with augmented limbs will instead have those
      limbs healed unless they drain especially massive amounts of power.
  - wip: Using Volt Void on top of a Sigil of Transmission will transfer most of the
      power drained to the Sigil of Transmission, effectively making it far less likely
      to damage the invoker.
  - rscdel: You can no longer stack most sigils and clockwork objects with themself.
      You can still have multiple different objects or sigils on a tile, however.
  - tweak: The Break Will Script has been renamed to Dementia Doctrine, is slightly
      faster, and causes slightly more brain damage.
  - tweak: The Judicial Visor now uses an action button instead of alt-click. Cultists
      of Nar-Sie judged by the visor will be stunned for half duration, but will be
      set on fire.
  - tweak: Multiple scriptures have had their component requirements changed. The
      Summon Judicial Visor Script has been reduced from a Script to a Driver.
  - rscadd: Recollection will now show both required and consumed components.
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders can now emerge from their host if their host is at
      or below 60% total health(for humans, this is 20 health out of crit)
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders will slowly heal if directly adjacent to their host
      and have a slightly larger threshold for their no-Fatigue bonus damage.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: Botany, atmospherics and cargo now all have access to high-capacity watertanks.
  - rscadd: The bar has now been outfitted with custom bar stools.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: Removed the global message played when Nar-Sie _begins_ to spawn (but
      not when it actually spawns).
  - tweak: Drunkenness recovery speed now increases with how drunk the imbiber is
      and is much quicker when the imbiber is asleep.
  - tweak: Suit storage units now take three seconds to enter (up from one) and have
      different sounds and messages for UV ray cauterization.
  - bugfix: Fixed some bugs with the suit storage unit, inserting mobs, and contents
      to seemed to duplicate themselves.
  - bugfix: The Summon Nar-Sie rune can now only be drawn on original station tiles
      and fails to invoke if scribed on the station then moved elsewhere.
  coiax:
  - rscdel: Bluespace shelter capsules can no longer be used on shuttles.
  - rscadd: Bluespace shelters may have different capsules stored. View what your
      capsule has inside by examining it.
  - rscdel: The Nar'sie rune cannot be scribed on shuttles or off Z-level.
  - rscadd: The Raise Dead rune automatically grabs the ghost of the raised corpse.
  - rscadd: Deadchat is now notified when a sentient mob dies.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Monkeys and all other animals that should have blood now has it. Beating
      them up will make you and your weapon bloody, just like beating a human does.
      Dragging them when wounded and lying will leave a blood trail. Their blood is
      still mostly cosmetic, they suffer no effects from low blood level, unlike humans.
  - rscadd: When a mob leaves a blood trail while dragged, it loses blood. You can
      no longer drag a corpse to make an inifinite amount of blood trails, because
      once the victim's blood reaches a certain threshold it no longer leaves a blood
      trail (and no longer lose any more blood). The threshold depends on how much
      damage the mob has taken. You can always avoid hurting the dragged mob by making
      them stand up or by buckling them to something or by putting them in a container.
  - rscdel: You can no longer empty a mob of its blood entirely with a syringe, once
      the mob's blood volume reaches a critically low level you are unable to draw
      any more blood from it.
  - tweak: A changeling absorbing a human now sucks all their blood.
2016-06-08:
  Cruix:
  - bugfix: Changelings no longer lose the regenerate ability if they respect while
      in regenerative stasis.
  Fox McCloud:
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor critical reactions not working
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor item cloning not working
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor producing coffee vending machines instead of coffe
      cups
  - tweak: Experimentor can only clone critical reaction items instead of anything
      with an origin tech
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has approved the Hyper-Kenetic Accelerator upgrade for cyborg
      mining modules.
  - tweak: Each of the heads' ID computers are now themed for their department!
  Joan:
  - tweak: Anima Fragments have slightly more health and move faster, but slow down
      temporarily when taking damage. Also they can move in space now.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The clown will play a sad trombone noise upon death.
  - rscadd: Colossi now roam the wastes.
  - rscadd: Bubblegum now roams the wastes.
  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: You can now emag chemical dispensers, such as the ones in chemistry or
      the bar, to unlock illegal chemicals.
  lordpidey:
  - tweak: Infernal jaunt has been significantly nerfed with an enter and exit delay.
2016-06-09:
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen scientists have completed a design for adapting mining cyborgs
      to the Lavaland Wastes in the form of anti-ash storm plating. Research for this
      technology must be adapted at your local station.
  Joan:
  - tweak: Anima Fragments have slightly less health and damage and will slow down
      for longer when hit.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The captain now spawns with the station charter, which allows him to name
      the station.
  Papa Bones:
  - tweak: Loyalty implants have been refluffed to mindshield implants, they are mechanically
      the same.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: You can now remove all plants and weeds from a hydroponics tray by using
      a spade on it.
  - rscadd: Added meatwheat, a mutated variant of wheat that can be crushed into meat
      substitute.
  - rscadd: Added ambrosia gaia, a mysterious plant that is rumored to provide nutrients
      and water to any soil - hydroponic or otherwise - that it's planted in.
  - rscadd: Added cherry bombs, a mutated variant of blue cherries that have an explosively
      good taste. Oh, and don't pluck the stems.
  coiax:
  - tweak: The beacons from support guardians are now structures, rather than replacing
      the floor tile. In practice, this will change little, aside from not leaving
      empty plating when a beacon is removed because a new one has been placed.
  nullbear:
  - tweak: Removes the restriction on wormhole jaunters, preventing them from teleporting
      you to beacons on other z-levels.
  - tweak: No longer able to use beacons to bypass normal shuttle/centcomm anti-bluespace
      measures.
2016-06-11:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Clockwork Slabs, Clockwork Caches near walls, and Tinkerer's Daemons will
      now be more likely to generate components that the clockwork cult has the least
      of.
  - rscadd: Destroyed Clockwork Caches will drop all Tinkerer's Daemons in them.
  - tweak: Clockwork Caches can now only generate a component every 30 seconds(when
      near a clockwork wall), Clockwork Slabs can only generate a component every
      40 seconds, and Tinkerer's Daemons can only generate a component every 20 seconds.
      This should result in higher component generation for everything except Clockwork
      Caches near clockwork walls.
  - tweak: Adding a component to a Clockwork Slab instead puts that component in the
      global component cache.
  - tweak: Clockwork Slabs only generate components if held by a mob or in a mob's
      storage, and when generating a component will prevent other Slabs held from
      generating a component.
  - tweak: The Replicant Driver no longer costs a Replicant Alloy to invoke; basically
      you can throw free Slabs at converts.
  - rscdel: Clockwork Slabs no longer have Repository as a menu option; instead, you
      can examine them to see how many components they have access to.
  - rscdel: Clockwork Caches directly on top of clockwork walls won't generate components
      from that wall.
  Lzimann:
  - rscadd: Bar stools are now constructable with metal!
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Ghosts are notified when someone arrives on the Arrivals Shuttle. This
      is independent of the announcement system, and the (F) link will follow the
      arrived person.
  - tweak: Slimes and aliens with custom names now retain those names when changing
      forms.
  kevinz000:
  - bugfix: Malf AI hacking an APC that is then destroyed will no longer bug the AI
  - bugfix: Being turned into a Revolutionary now stuns you for a short while.
  - bugfix: Kinetic Accelerators no longer drop their firing pin or cell when destroyed
      by lava
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Firelock assemblies can be reinforced with plasteel to construct heavy
      firelocks.
2016-06-12:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Attacking a human you are pulling or have grabbed with a ratvarian spear
      will impale them, doing massive damage, stunning the target, and breaking the
      spear if they remain conscious after being attacked.
  - tweak: The Function Call verb is now an action button.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: While experimenting with floral genetic engineering, Nanotrasen botanists
      discovered an explosive variety of the cherry plant. Due to gross misuse, the
      genes used to produce this strain have been isolated and removed while Central
      Command decides how best to modify it.
  xxalpha:
  - rscadd: 'New wizard spell: Spacetime Distortion.'
  - rscadd: 3x1 grafitti
2016-06-13:
  Joan:
  - tweak: Sigils of Transgression will now only stun for about 5 seconds, from around
      10 seconds.
  - tweak: Sigils of Submission take about 5 seconds to convert a target, from around
      3 seconds, and will glow faintly.
  - rscadd: Sigils of any type can be attacked with an open hand to destroy them,
      instead of requiring harm intent. Servants still require harm intent to do so.
  Lati:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has added one of their rare machine prototypes to cargo's selection.
      It might be valuable to research.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: You can now create living cake/cat hybrids through a slightly expensive
      crafting recipe. These "caks" are remarkably resilient, quickly regenerating
      any brute damage dealt, and can be attacked on harm intent to take a bite to
      be fed by a small amount. They serve as mobile sources of food and make great
      pets.
  - rscadd: If a brain occupied by a player is used in the crafting recipe for caks,
      that player then takes control of the cak!
2016-06-14:
  Joan:
  - tweak: The Gateway to the Celestial Derelict now takes exactly 5 minutes to successfully
      summon Ratvar and has 500 health, from 1000.
  - rscadd: You can now actually hit people adjacent to the Gateway; only the center
      of the Gateway can be attacked. The Gateway is also now dense, allowing you
      to more easily shoot at it.
  - rscadd: All Scripture in the Clockwork Slab's recital has a simple description.
  Razharas:
  - rscadd: Wiki now has the method of cultivating kudzu vines that was in game for
      over a year. https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Guide_to_hydroponics#Kudzu
  kevinz000:
  - tweak: Gravity Guns should no longer destroy local reality when set to attract
      and shot in an east cardinal direction. Added safety checks has slightly increased
      the cost of the gun's fabrication. Nanotrasen apologizes for the inconvenience.
  - bugfix: Gravity guns now have an inhand sprite.
2016-06-16:
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: In response to alarmingly high mining cyborg losses, Nanotrasen has equipped
      the units with an internal positioning beacon, as standard within the module.
  Joan:
  - rscadd: You can now strike a Tinkerer's Cache with a Clockwork Proselytizer to
      refill the Proselytizer from the global component cache.
  - tweak: The Clockwork Proselytizer requires slightly less alloy to convert windows
      and windoors.
  - tweak: Several clockwork objects have more useful descriptions, most notably including
      structures, which will show a general health level to non-servants and exact
      health to servants.
  - imageadd: The Clockwork Proselytizer has new, more appropriate inhands.
  - tweak: Invoking Inath-Neq, the Resonant Cogwheel, now gives total invulnerability
      to all servants in range for 15 seconds instead of buffing maximum health.
  - tweak: Impaling a target with a ratvarian spear no longer breaks the spear.
  - tweak: Judicial Markers(the things spawned from Ratvar's Flame, in turn spawned
      from a Judicial Visor) explode one second faster.
  - rscdel: Removed Dementia Doctrine, replacing it with an Application sigil.
  - rscadd: Adds the Sigil of Accession, the previously-mentioned Application sigil,
      which is much like a Sigil of Submission, except it isn't removed on converting
      un-mindshielded targets and will disappear after converting a mindshielded target.
  - tweak: Sigil of Submission is now a Script instead of a Driver; It's unlocked
      one tier up, so you have to rely on the Drivers you have until you get Scripts,
      instead of spamming both Driver sigils for free converts.
  - rscadd: To replace Sigil of Submission in the Driver tier; Added Taunting Tirade,
      which is a chanted scripture with a very fast invocation, which, on chanting,
      confuses, dizzies, and briefly stuns nearby non-servants and allows the invoker
      a brief time to relocate before continuing the chant.
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now see the Gateway to the Celestial Derelict's remaining time
      as a countdown.
  - tweak: Anima Fragments are now slightly slower if not at maximum health and no
      longer drop a soul vessel when destroyed.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscdel: Patches now hold only 40u.
  - rscdel: Patches in first aid kits now only contain 20u of chemicals.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Polymorphed mobs now have the same name, and where possible, the same
      equipment as their previous form.
2016-06-19:
  Joan:
  - tweak: Assassin holoparasite attack damage increased from 13 to 15, stealth cooldown
      decreased from 20 seconds to 16 seconds.
  - tweak: Charger holoparasite charge cooldown decreased from 5 seconds to 4 seconds.
  - tweak: Chaos holoparasite attack damage decreased from 10 to 7, range decreased
      from 10 to 7.
  - tweak: Lightning holoparasite attack damage increased from 5 to 7, chain damage
      increased by 33%.
  - rscdel: Clock cult scripture unlock now only counts humans and silicons.
  - rscadd: Servants of ratvar can now create cogscarab shells with a Script scripture.
      Adding a soul vessel to one will produce a small, drone-like being with an inbuilt
      proselytizer and tools.
  - imageadd: Clockwork mobs have their own speechbubble icons.
  - tweak: Invoking Sevtug now causes massive hallucinations, brain damage, confusion,
      and dizziness for all non-servant humans on the same zlevel as the invoker.
  - rscdel: Invoking Sevtug is no longer mind control. RIP mind control 2016-2016.
  - tweak: Clockwork slabs now produce a component every 50 seconds, from 40, Tinkerer's
      Caches now produce(if near a clockwork wall) a component every 35 seconds, from
      30.
  - experiment: 'Tinkerer''s daemons have a slightly higher cooldown for each component
      of the type they chose to produce that''s already in the cache: This is very
      slight, but it''ll add up if you have a lot of one component type and are trying
      to get more of it with daemons; 5 of a component type will add a second of delay.'
  Kor and Iamgoofball:
  - rscadd: Miners can now purchase fulton extraction packs.
  - rscadd: Miners can now purchase fulton medivac packs.
  - rscadd: Two new fulton related bundles are available for purchase with vouchers.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: Beepsky now has his own home in the labor shuttle room.
  Wizard's Federation:
  - bugfix: We've fired the old Pope, who was actually an apprentice in disguise.
      We've a-pope-riately replaced him with a much more experienced magic user.
  - rscadd: Some less-then-sane people have been sighted forming mysterious cults
      in lieu of recent Pope sightings, lashing out at anyone who speaks ill of him.
  - bugfix: We've rejiggered our trans-dimensional rifts, and almost all cases of
      clergy members being flung into nothingness should be resolved.
  - bugfix: All members of the Space Wizard's Clergy have been appropriately warned
      about usage of skin-to-stone spells, and such there should be no more instances
      of permanent statueification.
  Xhuis:
  - tweak: Revenants have been renamed to umbras and have undergone some tweaks.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Drones can hear robotic talk, but cannot communicate on it. AIs and cyborgs
      are encouraged to share information with station repair drones.
  - rscadd: Potted plants can now be ordered from cargo.
  - rscdel: AI turrets no longer fire at drones.
2016-06-20:
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Cult runes can only be scribed on station and on mining.

      but can also reattach lost limbs manually without surgery.
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now lose their limbs, but also can regenerate them if
      they have the jelly for it. Additionally slimepeople will (involuntarily) lose
      limbs and convert them to slime jelly if they're extremely low on jelly.
  - rscadd: Zombies and slimepeople now have reversed toxic damage, what usually heals
      now hurts and what usually hurts now heals. Keep in mind that while you could
      for example heal with unstable mutagen, you'd still mutate. Beware of secondary
      effects! Drugs like antitoxin are especially dangerous to these races now since
      not only do they do toxin damage, but they remove other toxic chems before they
      can heal you. Be wary also of wide band healing drugs like omnizine.
  - rscadd: For slime people the above mechanic also adds/drains slime jelly. So yes
      inhaling plasma is now a valid way to build jelly (but you'll still suffocate
      if there's no oxygen).

      somatoray.
2016-06-22:

      causing them to become confused and unequip their current module.
  Joan:
  - rscdel: Those who do not serve Ratvar cannot understand His creations.
  - rscadd: You can now repair clockwork structures with a clockwork proselytizer.
      This is about a third as efficient as a mending motor, costing 2 liquified alloy
      to 1 health, and also about a third as fast.
  - tweak: Scarab proselytizers are more efficient and will reap more alloy from metal
      and plasteel.
  - rscadd: They can also directly convert rods to alloy.
  - tweak: Nuclear bombs will no longer explode the station if in space. Please be
      aware of this.

  - tweak: Spatial Gateway will last four seconds per invoker, instead of two per
      invoker.
  - rscdel: Clockwork floors now only heal toxin damage on servants of Ratvar.

  - rscadd: Changelings now evolve powers via the cellular emporium, which they can
      access via an action button.
  - rscadd: Due to budget cuts, the shuttle's hyperspace engines now create a visual
      distortion at their destination, a few seconds before arrival. Crewmembers are

  - bugfix: Shuttles now only run over mobs in turfs they are moving into, rather
      than the entire rectangle.

      grilles to prevent accidental matter energising.
  coiax, incoming:
  - rscadd: Due to budget cuts, the builtin anti-orbit engines on the station have
      been removed. As such, expect the station to start orbiting the system again,
      and encounter an unpredictable stellar environment.
  - rscdel: All permanent structures (not on station, Centcom or lavaland) have been
      removed.
  - rscadd: All removed structures are now space ruins, and can be placed randomly
      in space ruin zlevels.
  - wip: The White Ship remains at its current location, but has lost any reliable
      landmarks near it. Its starting position will be made more random in a coming
      update.
  - rscadd: The Space Bar has a small atmos system added and a teleporter. Some other
      ruins have been cleaned up to not have atmos active turfs.
2016-06-24:
  Joan:
  - experiment: The Interdiction Lens has been reworked; instead of allowing you to
      disable Telecomms, Cameras, or non-Servant Cyborgs, it drains power from all
      APCs, SMES units, and non-Servant cyborgs in a relatively large area, funneling
      that power into nearby Sigils of Transmission, then disables all cameras and
      radios in that same area.
  - wip: If it fails to find anything it could disable or drain any power, it turns
      off for 2 minutes.
  - tweak: You can now target yourself with Sentinel's Compromise, allowing you to
      heal yourself with it.
  - rscadd: Flashes will once again stun borgs, but for a much shorter time than they
      previously did; average stun time is reduced from the previous average of 15
      seconds to about 6 seconds. The confusion remains, but it will no longer unequip
      borg modules.

  - rscadd: The Donor prompt for becoming an alien queen maid is now an action button
      instead, and can be toggled on and off.
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Fellowship Armory now invokes faster for each nearby servant and provides
      clockwork gauntlets, which are shock-resistant and provide armor to the arms.
  - tweak: It's not wise to equip clockwork armor if you don't serve Ratvar.
  - bugfix: A full set of clockwork armor will now actually cover all limbs.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Our administrators, here at /tg/, don't get enough credit for their wealth
      of experience and knowledge. Now they get the chance to share that with you
      by giving out custom tips!
  - tweak: Gang domination now uses the same timing method as shuttles, making their
      domination times more accurate.
  - rscdel: The default shuttle transit time is now 15 seconds.
  - rscadd: Please do not commit suicide with the nuclear authentication disk.

  - rscadd: Clockwork Marauders will take damage when attacked, but unless they're
      fighting excessive amounts, they'll be forced to return to their host before
      they'd normally die.
  - experiment: A holy weapon held in either hand in the presence of a marauder will
      massively increase the damage they take, making it much more likely the marauder
      can be killed.
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders do slightly less damage at low fatigue levels.
  - rscadd: Clockwork Marauders now have a chance to block melee attacks, negating
      the damage from them, and an additional chance to immediately counter, attacking
      whoever tried to attack them.
  - wip: If Ratvar has awoken, Marauders have a much higher chance to block and counter,
      will block thrown items and projectiles, and gradually regenerate.
  - experiment: Clockwork Marauders no longer have a verb to communicate; they instead
      use :b to do so.

      and as it was deemed unholy, he will no longer do it.
  - rscadd: Wizards of the Wizard's Federation have been granted access to Dark Seeds,
      ancient relics used to call upon Hades in a time of need.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: You can no longer put paper cups back onto water coolers. In addition,

      contents.
  coiax:

      meteors via an action button and watch them hit the station.
  - rscadd: Added Major Space Dust event, which is a meteor shower containing only
      space dust.
  - bugfix: Fixes bug where meteors wouldn't move when spawned.
  - rscadd: Meteor Shower split into three different events, Normal, Threatening and
      Catastrophic. They all have the same crew messages, but admins can tell the

      space turfs, rather than non-moving space.
  - rscadd: AIs get a notification when hacking an APC, which can be clicked to jump

      it up and bury it with something interesting!'
  Joan:

      legs, you have to opt in.
  - rscadd: All ash walker lizards however are forced to have these legs.

      easily.
  - rscadd: Accordingly Clockwork Marauders now have more health, do slightly more
      damage, block slightly more often, and have to go slightly further from their
      host to take damage.
  - rscadd: Marauders that are not recovering(from recalling while the host's health
      is too high to emerge) and are inside their host, or are within a tile of their

      to emerge.

      this ability's cooldown, and only one will be used per sentence.
  - rscadd: 'Use .x, :x, or #x as a prefix to use Voice of God or any future vocal
      cord organs.'
