tweak: Sales barcode profit splits will consistently default to 50% (you can still set this to less, but there's no reason to at the moment)
tweak: Sales tagger examine message improvements
tweak: Sales tagger and GrandArk Exporter tablet app both tell you the valid range to set the profit split in now"
  - spellcheck: "'Barcode tag' is now called 'barcode tag'"
