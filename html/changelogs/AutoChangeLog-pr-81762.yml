  - bugfix: "The captain's safe is no longer on the wall, therefore cannot be cheesed by breaking the wall it sits on."
  - bugfix: "Tearing down a wall that a safe is on now drops the safe with its contents, rather than dropping the contents onto the floor. The safe's contents cannot be interacted with while it's not on a wall."
