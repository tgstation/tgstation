changes:
  - balance: "Supermatter now takes 15 seconds to delaminate normally and 5 if a sliver has been taken from it. Gives a little more time to escape in the case of the sliver and also evens out the times to please perfectionists."
  - bugfix: "Supermatter now accurately reports it's detonation time."
  - spellcheck: "Supermatter mood descriptions have been reverted back to their old, more flavorful selves."
