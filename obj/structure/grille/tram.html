<p>if you map something on to the tram, make SURE if possible that it doesnt have anything reacting to its own movement
it will make the tram more expensive to move and we dont want that because we dont want to return to the days where
the tram took a third of the tick per movement when it's just carrying its default mapped in objects</p></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/tree/cd8d3cfc6452876b3929e640c2fd6fdbfee7f93f">cd8d3cf</a> (master) — <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.11.0</a></footer></body></html>
