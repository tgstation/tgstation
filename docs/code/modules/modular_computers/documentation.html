        <tr><td colspan="2"><p>Ok. so a quick rundown on how to make a program. This is kind of a shitty documentation, but oh well I was asked to.</p>
<h2>Base setup</h2>
<p>This is how the base program is setup. the rest is mostly tgui stuff. I'll use the ntnetmonitor as a base</p>
<pre><code class="language-DM">/datum/computer_file/program/ntnetmonitor
    /// This is obviously the name of the file itself. not much to be said
    filename = &quot;ntmonitor&quot;

    /// This is sort of the official name. it's what shows up on the main menu
    filedesc = &quot;NTNet Diagnostics and Monitoring&quot;

    /// This is what the screen will look like when the program is active
    program_icon_state = &quot;comm_monitor&quot;

    /// This is a sort of a description, visible when looking on the ntnet
    extended_desc = &quot;This program is a dummy.&quot;

    /// size of the program. Big programs need more hard drive space. Don't
    /// make it too big though.
    size = 12

    /// If this is set, the program will not run without an ntnet connection,
    /// and will close if the connection is lost. Mainly for primarily online
    /// programs.
    requires_ntnet = 1

    /// This is access required to run the program itself. ONLY SET THIS FOR
    /// SUPER SECURE SHIT. This also acts as transfer_access as well.
    required_access = access_network

    /// This is the access needed to download from ntnet or host on the ptp
    /// program. This is what you want to use most of the time.
    transfer_access = access_change_ids

    /// If it's available to download on ntnet. pretty self explanatory.
    available_on_ntnet = 1

    /// ditto but on emagged syndie net. Use this for antag programs
    available_on_syndinet = 0

    /// Bitflags (PROGRAM_CONSOLE, PROGRAM_LAPTOP, PROGRAM_TABLET combination)
    /// or PROGRAM_ALL. Use this to limit what kind of machines can run the
    /// program. For example, comms program should be limited to consoles and laptops.
    usage_flags = PROGRAM_ALL

    /// This one is kinda cool. If you have the program minimized, this will
    /// show up in the header of the computer screen. You can even have the
    /// program change what the header is based on the situation! See `alarm.dm`
    /// for an example.
    var/ui_header = &quot;downloader_finished.gif&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Preinstalls</h2>
<p>Now. for pre-installing stuff.</p>
<p>Primarily done for consoles, there's an install_programs() proc in the console presets file in the machines folder.</p>
<p>for example, the command console one.</p>
<pre><code class="language-DM">/obj/machinery/modular_computer/console/preset/command/install_programs()
    cpu.hard_drive.store_file(new/datum/computer_file/program/chatclient())
    cpu.hard_drive.store_file(new/datum/computer_file/program/card_mod())
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, you want to do  cpu.hard_drive.store_file(new/<em>program path here</em>()) and put it in the subtype's install_programs().
Probably pretty self explanatory, but just in case.</p>
<p>Will probably be expanded when new features come around or I get asked to mention something.</p></td></tr></table></main>
