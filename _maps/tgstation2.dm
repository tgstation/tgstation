/*
The /tg/ codebase currently requires you to have 7 z-levels of the same size dimensions.
z-level order is important, the order you put them in inside this file will determine what z level number they are assigned ingame.
Names of z-level do not matter, but order does greatly, for instances such as checking alive status of revheads on z1

current as of 2014/11/24
z1 = station
z2 = centcomm
z3 = derelict telecomms satellite
z4 = derelict station
z5 = mining
z6 = empty space
z7 = empty space
