I'm stuck on this shithole of an outpost, trying to avoid these damn eggheads running all over the place preparing for god knows what. There's no crimes to stop, no syndies to kill, and I'm not even allowed to beat the fuckin' assistant senseless! They said I was transferred from Space Station 13 for 'good behavior', but this feels more like a punishment than a reward. All I know is that if I don't get some action soon, I'm going to go insane.<br><br>Entry Two - 03/06/2554:<br>Okay, so get this: we got a fuckin' deathsquad coming in today! I thought the day I saw one of them would be the day my employment was 'terminated', if you get my drift. They're escorting some sort of weird alien creature for the eggheads to study. I heard one of the docs telling the chef that this thing killed a whole security force before it was captured. I sure as hell hope that I don't have to fight it.<br><br>Entry Three - 08/06/2554:<br>My first real bit of 'action' today, if you could call it that. Crazy Ivan got in a fight with Kuester today about his Booze-O-Mat. Apparently one of the crewmembers had stolen a couple bottles of booze from the machine after Ivan disabled the ID lock. Tell you the truth, I don't blame the thief. Everyone is going a little stir-crazy in here, and the bartender is being damn stingy with the alcohol. Either way, once they started to pick a fight, I had to take them down. It's a damn shame that we don't have a brig, though. I had to lock Ivan in a fuckin' freezer, for god's sake. Let's hope that we can keep our sanity together, at least for a while.<br><br>Entry Four - 10/06/2554:<br>Jesus fucking Christ riding on a motorbike. These things the scientists are studying are terrifying! Fucking great huge purple bug things as tall as the ceiling, with blades for arms and drooling at the mouth. I don't think my taser will do jack shit against these damn things, but the eggheads say that they're safely contained. If they do, I have a feeling that it's only a matter of time before we're all screwed. These bastards look like walking death.<br><br>Entry Five - 18/06/2554:<br>Finally caught who stole the booze from Kuester. It was that fuckin' loser assistant Steve! He was in the dorms, chugging his worries away. I took one of the bottles back to the barkeep, but no one has to know about this second one. I think I'm gonna enjoy this while watching tomorrow's Thunderdome match.<br><br>Entry Six - 19/06/2554:<br>Oh, great. The chef is still sleeping, so we get Ivan's gruel for breakfast today. I overheard Sano and Douglas saying something about the aliens being restless, so we might get some action today. As long as it happens after the big game, I'm fine with it.

While normally we would write these off as instinctual play for honing their skills when they molt, their growth period is so incredibly fast and they are still such adept killers that it would serve no practical purpose. The only explanation for this is perhaps to create bonds and friendships with each other, if that is even possible for such an incredibly hostile race. It may be that they are much more reasonable with each other than other life forms.<br><br>It had become clear that now was the best time to extract a xenomorph for dissecting, as these were all still larvae and the queen was still attached to its ovipositor and would be immobile.

This is by far the largest alien I have ever seen. The alien we were previously studying has molted and has become an absolutely enormous creature. Standing at over 15 feet tall and weighing in at likely two tons or more, the xenomorph queen is an absolutely breathtakingly large and cruel monster. Its behavior has changed drastically from when it was a drone, having become far more comfortable with sitting and staring at us, rather than smashing at the windows.<br><br>The queen, physiologically speaking, is fairly similar to the other xenomorphs, with a few key differences. Its enormous size demands large legs, while the back seems to be always hunched forward. The dorsal tubes on the back have changed to several large spikes, and we observed the alien now sports a second pair of smaller arms on its chest.  The purpose of these secondary arms is still unknown. Finally, the queen's crown has become incredibly large, with what seems to be a retractable slot to hide its head in. The dome appears to be extremely thick near the front, and will likely be able to resist a lot of trauma. Despite the enormous size it has grown to, it is not that much slower than it used to be.<br><br>After two hours of doing relatively nothing but staring, the queen began to produce an unusually large amount of resin and weeds, quickly shaping up a large nest that it then hid behind.

This had us all in agreement that this stage of the life cycle was the queen.<br><br>Over the next few hours, the eggs grew to their full sizes, and we provided the subject with new monkey hosts.

It seems its behavior has returned to a state that is very similar to the facehugger, though I doubt with the same intent! Thankfully, our glass and shields have shown to be more than sturdy enough for such a violent creature, and so far, any attempts at the creature escaping have been in vain.<br><br>As for its physiology, the creature has an elongated head with what appears to be have an exoskeleton resembling an external rib-cage on the torso. The alien is also fairly skinny with a lean body. The little amount of meat on the alien appears to be entirely muscle.  We assume this makes it deceptively strong, while remaining agile at the same time.  One of the most interesting things we have seen is its pharyngeal jaw.  It has some what of an inner mouth capable of being fired externally at extremely high speeds. It has already caused many dents in the walls and a few small cracks in the window with it.

The larva quickly attacked and ate the mouse and seemed to get larger very suddenly, this suggests that the larvae are capable of metabolizing and directing all the energy towards growth at previously thought impossible speeds.

They have been observed to have a much wider head and lack dorsal tubes. They have shown to be less agile and visibly more fragile than any other caste.

I saw that corporate needed a research director for one of it's outposts and thought it would be a cakewalk, there isn't going to be a lot of research to be done on a tiny outpost. Mainly just running scans on the gas giant we are orbiting or some basic RnD. However, they conveniently forgot to tell me that me and my science staff would have to pull double duty as medical staff and that there is no one higher up on the chain of command here, so I get to pull triple duty as acting captain as well! This shit is probably allowed in some 3 point fine print buried underneath the literally thousands of pages of contracts. Well, at least the research will be easy work.<br><br>Entry Two - 25/05/2554:<br>Well, we all expected it at the outpost, CentComm has decided to completely change what research we are doing. They've decided that we should be research the species known as 'xenomporphs'. They announced this change 4 days ago and along with it, sadly, the termination of our current science staff barring me. Not to mention the constant noise made by the construction detail they sent to staple on an xenobiology lab ensuring no one has been able to sleep decently ever since they announced the shift. To make matters worse our current security guard actually died of a heart attack today. Just goes to show that 75 year old men shouldn't be security guards. Still can't believe that they decided to do this major change less than a month after the outpost was established.<br><br>Entry Three - 27/05/2554:<br>The new security guard arrived today. Apparently transferred here from the research station that also is orbiting the gas giant. He seems to be rather angry about his transfer. Considering the rumors I've heard about the research station he's probably caught off guard by the fact that Steve hasn't tried to force an IED down his throat.<br><br>Entry Four - 06/06/2554:<br>My requests for additional security and containment measures for the 'xenomorph' has been denied. Does Central Command not notice how dangerous these creatures are? The only thing keeping them in is a force field, a minor problem with the power grid and the entire hive is loose. What would stop them then, the lone security guard with a dinky little taser? Kenneth can barely handle a short-tempered engineer. We are under equipped and under staffed, we are inevitably going to be destroyed unless we get the equipment and staff we need.<br><br>Entry Five - 10/06/2554:<br>Cunningham got a good look at the xenomorph in containment. He was frightened for the rest of the day, rather amusing if it wasn't for the fact that we are all trapped on this scrap heap with naught but a force field keeping those xenomorphs in.<br><br>Entry Six - 17/06/2554:<br>The reactions from the specimens today has shown that they possess strange mental properties. Mark hypothesizes that they possibly have a sort of hive mind, while nothing is certain this would explain how xenomorphs seem to have vastly increased intellect when a 'queen' is present. Of course, to test this hypothesis would require many complicated procedures which we will not be able to undertake. But we do not know the full extend of the xenomorph mind, it may or may not be able to find a way to circumvent our containment system.
