# This mode is for an experiment with directional visibility within one tile.
# It first performs a bitmask slice, and then does an extra cut where it cuts out a "direction"
# version for each direction. This "direction" version is intended to represent what would be
# visible from that side of the wall
mode: !BitmaskDirectionalVis
  # These values are "inherited" from BitmaskSlice
  # Because the first "phase" is a normal bitmask slice, that step is configured by the same values
  # see the bitmask-slice example for what these do!

  # This is the actual new config of dir visibility

  # The rest becomes transparency.
