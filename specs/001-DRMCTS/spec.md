# Feature Specification: AI-Controlled Human Crew Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to have an AI foundation that controls non-player controlled human crew. I'd like the AI to be heuristic (Doubly Robust Monte Carlo Tree Search) for actions, movement, and the usage of items and equipment."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Detect human crew characters lacking active player control
   → Confirm the crew member is eligible for AI takeover (role, status, constraints)
2. Activate AI control framework for eligible crew
   → Pull situational data (location, objectives, threats, resources)
3. Evaluate possible actions using heuristic decision policy aligned with doubly robust MCTS goals
   → Score options for movement, interactions, and equipment usage against crew objectives
   → Select actions with the exploration term `a* = argmax_a (Q(h,a) + c_pi * b(a|h) * N(h) / (1 + N(h,a)))` where `Q(h,a)` is the backed-up value estimate, `b(a|h)` is the learned behavior prior, `N(h)` is total visits to history `h`, `N(h,a)` is visits to edge `(h,a)`, and `c_pi` tunes exploration pressure, with `c_pi` scaled per action taxonomy so emergency, maintenance, and routine behaviors can bias exploration differently
4. Select the highest-utility action that respects station rules and safety policies
   → Resolve conflicts with player-controlled orders or higher-priority directives
5. Execute chosen action and observe outcome signals (success, failure, side effects)
6. Update AI knowledge state with outcomes to refine subsequent decisions
7. Repeat evaluation loop at defined cadence while crew remains AI-controlled
```

---

- Maintain believable human-like behavior for AI crew so players perceive consistent station activity.
- Prioritize station safety, mission objectives, and role fidelity over opportunistic or chaotic actions.
- Ensure AI deactivates or defers immediately when a player assumes control or issues overriding commands.
- Deliver a demonstrably complete janitor-duty workflow as the initial success benchmark for the AI foundation.
- Balance computational complexity so heuristic planning does not impair overall server performance; no hard per-agent budget is currently defined.
- Track and expose transparent behavior summaries for game masters to audit AI decisions through an administrator-facing TGUI blackboard that surfaces current AI activity.
- Provide the AI foundation as a dedicated root-level module so existing .dm systems can incorporate it consistently once approved.
- Establish an action taxonomy (Routine Upkeep, Maintenance & Logistics, Medical Response, Security & Emergency, Social & Support) and attach default exploration scaling per category so behavioral priors reflect each role's urgency.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A game administrator wants unattended human crew slots to remain active, so the AI takes over idle crew members, moves them through their daily duties, and interacts with equipment in a believable, rule-abiding way until a player resumes control.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a human crew member without a player controller, **When** the AI framework evaluates the environment, **Then** the crew member should begin performing role-appropriate actions that align with station goals and safety policies.
2. **Given** an AI-controlled crew member currently executing an action, **When** the janitor workflow is initialized, **Then** the AI must complete a full janitor duty loop (identify mess, gather tools, clean, dispose waste, confirm area status) without manual intervention.
3. **Given** an AI-controlled crew member currently executing an action, **When** a player reclaims that character, **Then** the AI must immediately halt, hand over control without residual effects, and log the transition for administrators.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple AI crew members converge on limited critical equipment at the same time? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: conflict resolution rules]
- How does system handle AI crew responding to emergencies that exceed predefined heuristics (e.g., unexpected station catastrophes)?
- How could players grief or exploit this? What guardrails prevent it? (Example: forcing AI crew into hazardous loops, baiting them into friendly fire, or farming AI reactions for advantage.) Well-planned heuristics should minimize these behaviors, but administrator overrides remain available for anomalies.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST assume control of eligible human crew characters whenever no player is actively directing them and the game rules permit AI intervention.
- **FR-002**: System MUST evaluate available actions for each AI-controlled crew member every 1.5 seconds on average (with staggered updates to avoid spikes), running doubly robust Monte Carlo tree search to a depth of three decision steps with a rollout budget capped at 200 simulations per cycle.
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure AI-controlled crew prioritize core station responsibilities (e.g., maintenance, medical support, security patrols) according to their assigned roles, with the janitor workflow serving as the baseline validation target. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authoritative role objectives]
- **FR-004**: System MUST govern movement, equipment usage, and interactions so outcomes comply with station laws, safety protocols, and escalation rules.
- **FR-005**: System MUST immediately relinquish control and cease queued actions when a player takes over or an administrator issues an override.
- **FR-006**: System MUST record meaningful telemetry for each AI decision cycle, including chosen action, rationale indicators, and contextual factors, and make the stream visible within an administrator TGUI blackboard interface. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: telemetry retention duration]
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect and mitigate repetitive or immersion-breaking behavior patterns (e.g., pacing loops, item spamming) through corrective heuristics or administrator alerts.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide configuration points for administrators to adjust aggressiveness, safety thresholds, and task priorities without modifying game code. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: configuration interface expectations]
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide an administrator-accessible TGUI blackboard that summarizes each AI-controlled crew member's current objective, recent actions, and pending decisions.
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose configuration that attaches exploration scaling values to action categories so administrators can tune `c_pi` (or equivalent multipliers) per action type based on observed telemetry.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AI Crew Profile**: Represents an AI-controlled human crew character, including role assignment, status flags, and behavior modifiers such as risk tolerance or duty priorities.
- **Situational Context Snapshot**: Captures environment data the AI uses each cycle (locations, nearby entities, available equipment, current alerts, player commands).
- **Decision Telemetry Record**: Summarizes each decision evaluation, including candidate actions, selected action, utility scores, and outcome feedback for auditing.
- **Administrator Control Policy**: Defines adjustable parameters and governance rules that constrain AI behaviors and override conditions.
