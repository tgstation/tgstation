# All -> 8 directions per frame, arranged in the same pattern as cardinals
#   ... in order SOUTH, NORTH, EAST, WEST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, NORTHEAST, NORTHWEST
# CardinalsRotated -> 1 direction per frame, will be expanded in the dmi to be Cardinals, with each
#   ... direction being that base junction, rotated in whatever way. Exists mostly so client.dir supporting states
#   ... can be created. Creates a lot of duplicate blocks otherwise.
