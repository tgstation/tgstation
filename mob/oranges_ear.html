<li>
<p>turns out view() spends a significant portion of its processing time generating lists of contents of viewable turfs which includes EVERYTHING on it visible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the turf itself. there is an optimization to view() which makes it only iterate through either /obj or /mob contents, as well as normal list typechecking filters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a fuckton of these are generated as part of its SS's init and stored in a list, when requested for a list of movables returned by the spatial grid or by some</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>superset of the final output that must be narrowed down by view(), one of these gets put on every turf that contains the movables that need filtering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and each is given references to the movables they represent. that way you can do for(var/mob/oranges_ear/ear in view(...)) and check what they reference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as opposed to for(var/atom/movable/target in view(...)) and checking if they have the properties you want which leads to much larger lists generated by view()</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and also leads to iterating through more movables to filter them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLDR: iterating through just mobs is much faster than all movables when iterating through view() on average, this system leverages that to boost speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enough to offset the cost of allocating the mobs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>named because the idea was first made by oranges and i didnt know what else to call it (note that this system was originally made for get_hearers_in_view())</p>
