<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>Thursday, August 26, 21:07</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Open Source Release</strong>  Thanks to Mport for releasable singularity code.</li>
	<li><strong>Cyborgs redone</strong> Thanks again to Mport for this, cyborgs are totally different now.</li>
	<li>Engine Monitor PDA app is now Power Monitor PDA app, and actually works.</li>
	<li>AI State Laws verb now allows the AI to choose which laws to state, in case of traitor AIs or laws ordering it not to state them.  Hopefully this will cut down on 'OMG THE AI IS COPYING AND PASTING' metagaming.</li>
	<li>Power Monitor circuitboard isn't mislabeled as Mass Driver Control any more.</li>
	<li><strong>Traitor and Rev-head clowns lose the clumsiness gene</strong> - this should make trying to flash people in Rev mode less of an exercise in frustration.</li>
	<li>A sink has been added to the Fitness room - this lets you wash dirty and bloodstained clothing and equipment.</li>
	<li>Blast doors and firedoors no longer open by just bumping into them.</li>
	<li>The bar and kitchen now open onto the same seating area.  The old cafeteria area is now used as a lockerroom to replace the old one which was displaced by Hydroponics.</li>
	<li>The bar now has a space piano with which you can entertain and annoy the crew.</li>
	<li><strong>LIBRARY</strong>  A library has been added to the station in the escape arm in order to educate the crew.  The new Librarian job is available to manage it.  Crewmembers can request and read books, or write and bind their own books for upload to a persistent database.</li>
	<li>The supply of flashbangs available from Security has been reduced to cut down on people constantly flashbanging the escape shuttle.</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Friday, August 06, 20:32</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hydroponics/Botany Added</strong> Credit goes to Skie and the folks over at the independent opensource SS13 branch, this is their code. It's lacking a lot, but it's a great start!</li>
	<li>Way more tweaks than I can remember. Shouldn't wait so long between changelog updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tuesday, July 13, 22:35</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Singularity Engine Added</strong> Oh God we're all going to die (All credit on this one goes to Mport2004)</li>
	<li>'Purge' AI module added - purges ALL laws (except for law 0). Will probably change this to a Syndicate only item</li>
	<li>Cyborgs now spawn with a power cell. Should prevent stupid cyborg deaths (and also pave the way for starting as a cyborg once more bugs are fixed)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Saturday, July 10, 15:10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Examining a player will now tell you if their client has disconnected.</li>
	<li>Examining a brain will now tell you if it's owner is still connected to the game.</li>
	<li>Alien Queens can make facehuggers. Facehuggers can make larva. Larva can grow into xenos! Xenos can become queens! The circle of life~</li>
	<li>Some powernet bug fixes: Bad list and division by zero.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Friday, July 09, 05:16</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Tweaked crate costs for Quartermaster.</li>
	<li>Increased metal available in Robotics.</li>
	<li><b>Added department-specific headsets.</b> Engineering, Medical, Command, and Security all receive special headsets capable of broadcasting on a standard frequency PLUS a secure frequency only available to headsets of the same type. Precede say messages with ":h" to use.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tuesday, July 06, 19:16</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Prayer command added.</li>
	<li>State Laws command for AI added.</li>
	<li>Disabled Lockdown command for AI. Too server heavy.</li>
	<li>Crew manifest and various station databases should properly update when late arrivals join the game, now.</li>
	<li>Quartermasters will receive 10 points every five minutes. This will probably be nerfed heavily, but we'll give it a shot anyhow.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug with doors/airlocks. (Thanks Mport2004)</li>
