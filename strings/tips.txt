As an Atmospheric Technician, burning a plasma/oxygen mix inside the incinerator will not only produce power, but also gases such as tritium, water vapor and carbon dioxide.
As an Atmospheric Technician, look into replacing your gas pumps with volumetric gas pumps, as those move air in flat numerical amounts, rather than percentages which leave trace gases.

As the Bartender, you can use a circular saw on your shotgun to make it easier to store.
As the Bartender, remember to set up the bar sign by walking up to it and clicking it!
As the Blob, don't neglect the creation of factories. These create spores that carry your reagent and can chase crew members far further than you. Spores can also be rallied to swarm the crew and cause panic, and can even take over corpses to create much more dangerous blob zombies!
As the Blob, keep your core some distance from space, as it is both expensive to expand onto space, easy to be attacked from, and does not count towards your win condition. Emitter platforms built in space are especially dangerous.

As the Blob, you can re-pick your reagent type from six random options if the crew has adapted and protected themselves against your current one.
As the Blob, you fight a war of attrition: Take out medbay and fight in choke points to prevent continued assaults and coordinated burst damage attacks!

As the Captain, you are one of the highest priority targets on the station. Everything from revolutions, to nuclear operatives, to traitors that need to rob you of your unique lasgun or your life are things to worry about.
As the Captain, you can purchase a new emergency shuttle using a communications console. Some require cash, while others give you cash in exchange. Keep in mind that purchasing dangerous shuttles may instigate the ire of your crew.
As the Captain, you have absolute access and control over the station, but this does not mean that being a horrible person won't result in mutiny and a ban.
As the Chaplain, you are much more likely to get a response by praying to the gods than most people. To boost your chances, make altars with colorful crayon runes, lit candles, and wire art.

As the Head of Security, don't let the power go to your head. You may have high access, great equipment, and a miniature army at your side, but being a terrible person without a good reason is grounds for banning.
As the Head of Security, you are expected to coordinate your security force to handle any threat that comes to the station. Sometimes it means making use of the armory to handle a blob, sometimes it means being ruthless during a revolution or cult.
As the Head of Security, you can call for executions or forced cyborgization, but may require the Captain's approval.
As the Lawyer, try to negotiate with the Warden if sentences seem too high for the crime.
As the Lawyer, you can try to convince the Captain and Head of Security to hold trials for prisoners in the courtroom.

As the Quartermaster, you can construct an express supply console that instantly delivers crates by drop pod. The impact will cause a small explosion as well.
As the Research Director, you can lock down cyborgs instead of blowing them up. Then you can have their laws reset or if that doesn't work, safely dismantled.
