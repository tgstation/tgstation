		"As mining operations on Freja continue, several explorers have discovered abnormal caverns and tunnels within the moon.

The library is known to contain several books on the occult, which occasionally demonstrate anomalous or paranormal properties.

The company thanks you for your cooperation in this matter.",
		"Due to recent events, the company would like to remind the crew that the Supermatter is not a toy, and the Engineering staff should avoid any unnecessary contact with it - yes, lighting a cigarette on it is considered unnecessary contact. The company thanks you for your cooperation in this matter.",
		"Due to recent events, the company would like to remind the crew to wash their hands regularly, and to avoid contact with any bodily fluids or hazardous materials. Especially for the exploration teams, and especially after contact with any alien flora or fauna. The company thanks you for your cooperation in this matter.",
		"Employee unrest has spiked in recent weeks, with several stations and outposts reporting attempted mutinies and riots. The Syndicate denies involment, but recent reports from the Internal Affairs division state that they have been actively researching mind suggestion and mass hypnosis techniques, so the company has not ruled out their involvement. In the event that the crew start to demand higher wages or better working conditions, the company advises the Captain to remain calm and to avoid any rash decisions, and to report any signs of unrest to Central Command immediately.",

		"One of the company's containment facilities was recently @pick(attack) by the Gorlex Marauders. The facility was being used to store several dangerous and exotic specimens, including codename Gamma - a highly adapted and dangerous alien creature. It is now believed that the Tiger Collective has inducted Gamma into their ranks, and will likely be using it to infiltrate and sabotage stations and colonies across the sector.",
		"One of the company's trading routes was recently @pick(attack) by the Gorlex Marauders. High casualties were reported, but amidst recovery operations, it has been noted that little was stolen outside of the contents of one ship - a high security transport ship containing a nuclear fission explosive device. Fortunately, the device cannot be armed without nuclear authorization code from Central Command. At the time we are unsure of their plans for it, but the company advises the Captain and Security team keep the station's self destruct codes secure, as there is a possibility that they could be reverse engineered to bypass security measures on the device.",

Members of their research staffs have resorted to superstitious beliefs and rituals, including blood sacrifice to appease 'the Geometer' and strange invocations. The Wizard Federation denies any involment in these events, and the company has no reason to doubt this statement - signs point towards the Cult of Nar'Sie as the likely culprit, but there is no concrete evidence at this time. The company advises all crew members to remain vigilant, and to report any strange activity to your station's security team immediately.",

		"The Internal Affairs division would like to remind the crew that they do not have any direct involvement in station affairs.

		"The Wizard Federation were reported to be holding a convention in the Spinward Sector recently, though the exact location is unknown.

		"The company would like to inform the crew that the recent expansion of Bluespace Artillery platforms in the Spinward Sector is not a cause for concern - these batteries exist to protect the the inner station and colonies from larger threats, and are not authorized for offensive use.",
