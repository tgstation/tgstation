This is Harshland's downstream fork of Skyrat, created entirely in the BYOND engine.

Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!

## COMPILE

On **2021-01-04** we have changed the way to compile the codebase.

Find `BUILD.bat` here in the root folder of Harshlands, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.
