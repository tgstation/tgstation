This is the codebase for the /tg/station flavoured fork of SpaceStation 13.

Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!

## DOWNLOADING

[Downloading](.github/guides/DOWNLOADING.md)

[Running a server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md)

[Maps and Away Missions](.github/guides/MAPS_AND_AWAY_MISSIONS.md)

## Compilation

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building tgstation in DreamMaker directly is deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
