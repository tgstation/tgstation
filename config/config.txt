###Master Controller High Pop Mode###

##The Master Controller(MC) is the primary system controlling timed tasks and events in SS13 (lobby timer, game checks, lighting updates, atmos, etc)
##Default base MC tick rate (1 = process every "byond tick" (see: tick_lag/fps config settings), 2 = process every 2 byond ticks, etc)
##	Setting this to 0 will prevent the Master Controller from ticking
BASE_MC_TICK_RATE 1

##High population MC tick rate
##	Byond rounds timer values DOWN, but the tick rate is modified with heuristics during lag spites so setting this to something like 2
##	will make it run every 2 byond ticks, but will also double the effect of anti-lag heuristics. You can instead set it to something like
##	1.1 to make it run every 1 byond ticks, but will increase the effect of anti-lag heuristics by 10%. or 1.5 for 50%.
##	(As an aside, you could in theory also reduce the effect of anti-lag heuristics in the base tick rate by setting it to something like 0.5)
##
##	Note: The reason to set this at/above 2 would be to carve out more time for sleeping procs and muck with scheduling the mc.
##	Basically if set to 2 one tick will be dominated by sleeping procs, and the other has... a chance of being dominated by the mc (a low chance but yaknow)
##	This is largely deprecated behavior, we have systems that do this automatically and more effectively. I'm keeping this here because of the heuristics stuff
##	since I have a weaker grasp on that, but it should basically never be set above 2 (guarantees skipped ticks and horrible gameplay)
HIGH_POP_MC_TICK_RATE 1.1

##Engage high pop mode if player count raises above this (Player in this context means any connected user. Lobby, ghost or in-game all count)

## Assets can opt-in to caching their results into `cache/`.
## This is important, as preferences assets take upwards of 30 seconds (without sleeps) to collect.
## The cache is assumed to be cleared by TGS recompiling, which deletes `cache/`.
## This should be disabled (through `CACHE_ASSETS 0`) on development,
## but enabled on production (the default).
CACHE_ASSETS 0

## Enables 'smart' asset caching, for assets that support it.
## This is a type of asset cache that automatically invalidates itself based on inputs to the asset generation.
## The cache is stored in `data/spritesheets/smart_cache/`.
## It lowers the generation cost and is safe to enable on development and production.
## This cache is only cleared by the game or manually, but it shouldn't affect the results.
## This setting is independent of `CACHE_ASSETS`, they do not affect each other whatsoever.
SMART_CACHE_ASSETS

## If this is uncommented, we will save all associated spritesheet PNGs and CSS files to a folder in the round-specific logs folder.
## Useful for developers to debug potential spritesheet issues to determine where the issue is cropping up (either in DM-side sprite generation or in the TGUI-side display of said spritesheet).
## Will only seek to waste disk space if ran on production.
#SAVE_SPRITESHEETS

## If this remains commented out, we will allow players to download their own preferences as a JSON file to do whatever they wish.
