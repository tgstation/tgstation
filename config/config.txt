## Unhash this entry to have certain jobs require your account to be at least a certain number of days old to select. You can configure the exact age requirement for different jobs by editing
## the minimal_player_age variable in the files in folder /code/game/jobs/job/.. for the job you want to edit. Set minimal_player_age to 0 to disable age requirement for that job.
## REQUIRES the database set up to work. Keep it hashed if you don't have a database set up.
## NOTE: If you have just set-up the database keep this DISABLED, as player age is determined from the first time they connect to the server with the database up. If you just set it up, it means
## you have noone older than 0 days, since noone has been logged yet. Only turn this on once you have had the database up for 30 days.
