## REQUIRES the database set up to work. Keep it hashed if you don't have a database set up.
## NOTE: If you have just set-up the database keep this DISABLED, as player age is determined from the first time they connect to the server with the database up. If you just set it up, it means

## Game Chat Message Options
## Various messages to be sent to connected chat channels.
## Uncommenting these will enable them, by default they will be broadcast to Game chat channels on TGS3 or non-admin channels on TGS4.
## If using TGS4, the string option can be set as one of more chat channel tags (separated by ','s) to limit the message to channels with that tag name (case-sensitive). This will have no effect on TGS3.
## i.e. CHAT_ANNOUNCE_NEW_GAME chat_channel_tag

###Master Controller High Pop Mode###

##The Master Controller(MC) is the primary system controlling timed tasks and events in SS13 (lobby timer, game checks, lighting updates, atmos, etc)
##Default base MC tick rate (1 = process every "byond tick" (see: tick_lag/fps config settings), 2 = process every 2 byond ticks, etc)
##	Setting this to 0 will prevent the Master Controller from ticking
BASE_MC_TICK_RATE 1

##High population MC tick rate
##	Byond rounds timer values UP, but the tick rate is modified with heuristics during lag spites so setting this to something like 2
##	will make it run every 2 byond ticks, but will also double the effect of anti-lag heuristics. You can instead set it to something like
##	1.1 to make it run every 2 byond ticks, but only increase the effect of anti-lag heuristics by 10%. or 1.5 for 50%.
##	(As an aside, you could in theory also reduce the effect of anti-lag heuristics in the base tick rate by setting it to something like 0.5)
HIGH_POP_MC_TICK_RATE 1.1

##Engage high pop mode if player count raises above this (Player in this context means any connected user. Lobby, ghost or in-game all count)
HIGH_POP_MC_MODE_AMOUNT 65

##Disengage high pop mode if player count drops below this
DISABLE_HIGH_POP_MC_MODE_AMOUNT 60

## Uncomment to prevent the world from sleeping while no players are connected after initializations

## Uncomment to set the number of /world/Reboot()s before the DreamDaemon restarts itself. 0 means restart every round. Requires tgstation server tools.

##Default view size, in tiles.
##	By default, this is 15x15, which gets simplified to 7 by byond
##  15x15 would be the standard square view. 21x15 is what goonstation uses for widescreen.
##  Setting this to something different from DEFAULT_VIEW_SQUARE will enable widescreen toggles
##	Do note that changing this value will affect the title screen. The title screen will have to be updated manually if this is changed.
DEFAULT_VIEW 19x15

##Default view size, in tiles. Should *always* be square.
## The alternative square viewport size if you're using a widescreen view size
## You probably shouldn't ever be changing this, but it's here if you want to.
DEFAULT_VIEW_SQUARE 15x15

## Assets can opt-in to caching their results into `tmp`.
## This is important, as preferences assets take upwards of 30 seconds (without sleeps) to collect.
