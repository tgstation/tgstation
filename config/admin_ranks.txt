# ADMIN RANK DEFINES                                                                                         #
# The format of this is very simple. Rank name goes first.                                                   #
# Rank is CASE-SENSITIVE, all punctuation save for '-', '_' and '@' will be stripped so spaces don't matter. #
# You can then define permissions for each rank by adding a '=' followed by keywords                         #
# These keywords represent groups of verbs and abilities.                                                    #
# keywords are preceded by either a '+' or a '-', + adds permissions, - takes them away.                     #
# +@ (or +prev) is a special shorthand which adds all the rights of the rank above it.                       #
# You can also specify verbs like so +/client/proc/some_added_verb or -/client/proc/some_restricted_verb     #
# Ranks with no keywords will just be given the most basic verbs and abilities                ~Carn          #
