## We suggest editing these variables ingame to find a good speed for your server.
## To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame.
## Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals ingame.
## To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied. 
RUN_DELAY 1
WALK_DELAY 4

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types.

### Configure the bomb cap
## This caps all explosions to the specified range. Used for both balance reasons and to prevent overloading the server and lagging the game out.
## This is given as the 3rd number(light damage) in the standard (1,2,3) explosion notation. The other numbers are derived by dividing by 2 and 4.
## eg: If you give the number 20. The bomb cap will be 5,10,20.
## Can be any number between 4 and 128, some examples are provided below.

## Default (3,7,14)
BOMBCAP 14
## One 'step' up (4,8,16) (recommended if you enable REACTIONARY_EXPLOSIONS above)

## LagHell (7,14,28)
