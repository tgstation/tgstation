## These are for reference and can help you configure the save and load settings
##
## Save File Size:
## A full station z-level (255x255) is ~3 MB
## An empty space z-level (255x255) is ~0.5 MB
## An autosave on Meta with all default z-levels is ~10 MB
## Autosaving 100 times, with all default z-levels on Meta, would be ~1 GB
##
## RAM Usage:
## Be aware that BYOND is a 32-bit application and has a RAM limit of 4 GB
## A full station z-level can consume approximately ~125 MB of RAM when loaded
## A single empty space z-level will also consume ~10 MB of RAM
## Loading 100 z-levels, with all of them empty space, will utilize ~1 GB of RAM
##
## Station Traits:
## Certain station traits and random events are not compatiable with persistence on the station z-level
## FORBID_STATION_TRAITS and ALLOW_RANDOM_EVENTS in game_options.txt allows you to disable them

## To enable map saving and loading that persists between rounds, uncomment this flag
## This will load the most recent saved map(s) in the _maps/persistence folder if available
## Save folders in the persistence directory are formatted as year-month-day_UTF_hour.minute.second
#PERSISTENT_SAVE_ENABLED

## The period of time in hours between map autosaves for persistence
## Set to -1 to only allow saving when the server reboots
## Defaults to every 4 hours
PERSISTENT_AUTOSAVE_PERIOD 4

## The maximum number of autosaves to store
## Set to -1 to never delete any autosaves
PERSISTENT_MAX_AUTOSAVES -1

## Include specific z levels when saving and loading determined by ZTRAIT
## CentCom and Transit/Reserved z-levels can be saved but are never loaded
## It is recommended to disable them to avoid saving unnecessary data
PERSISTENT_SAVE_Z_LEVELS CentCom
PERSISTENT_SAVE_Z_LEVELS Station
PERSISTENT_SAVE_Z_LEVELS Mining
PERSISTENT_SAVE_Z_LEVELS Space Empty
PERSISTENT_SAVE_Z_LEVELS Space Ruins
PERSISTENT_SAVE_Z_LEVELS Ice Ruins
PERSISTENT_SAVE_Z_LEVELS Transit/Reserved
PERSISTENT_SAVE_Z_LEVELS Away Mission

## This loads a fixed grid layout (not randomized) from the z-level JSON files if they were linked together
## Requires "Space Empty", "Space Ruins", and "Ice Ruins" to be enabled in PERSISTENT_SAVE_Z_LEVELS to work
PERSISTENT_USE_STATIC_MAP_GRID

## This section includes specific flags that control which types of data are saved and loaded
##
## Note on template_noop when loading maps:
## These placeholders are automatically replaced with the world's default turf or area from `\code\world.dm`
## The current world defaults are turf = /turf/open/space/basic and area = /area/space
