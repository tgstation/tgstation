- `nanomap-renderer` - A linux application to render NanoMap images of the ingame maps automatically. Based off of SpacemanDMM (Modified source [here](https://github.com/AffectedArc07/ParaSpacemanDMM), original source [here](https://github.com/Spacemaniac/SpacemanDMM))
- `nanomap-renderer-invoker.sh` - A script which invokes the render tool and clones the maps to the correct directory
